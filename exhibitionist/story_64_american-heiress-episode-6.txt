The month is July, the year 1978. Stephanie arrives in Denver, Colorado. In a wealthy suburb of the city, she stays in one of her father's properties which she has inherited; a mansion high on a foothill which overlook the Rocky Mountains. As soon as she settles in, taking a break from her road trip, Stephanie, who inherited stock in her father's hotel business, including the one in Denver, the Gold Rush Hotel, is called to a meeting of hoteliers in Denver. There she meets and butts heads with a cocky young 20 year old CEO of a hotel chain, Jake. As it turns out, he is her neighbor in the mountainside neighborhood. Jake is able to spy on Stephanie as she sun bathes in the nude and swims in the pool in the nude; and other activities in the nude as he uses his binoculars and telescope. Stephanie, who has her own binoculars and telescope, is also spying on Jake. They are both attracted to each other physically but can't stand each other. They play a game of voyeur and exhibitionist back and forth. Sometimes Stephanie teases him with her body, masturbating; and other times Jake shows off his body to her flexing his biceps and doing nude work outs and push-ups; including one night in which he is having sex with a young woman, presumably his girlfriend or lover. During the final conference of the hoteliers in Denver, unable to stand it anymore, Stephanie and Jake give in to their lust and after the conference ends, they stay behind and have sex on the conference table. Jake finger fucks Stephanie's pussy and then takes her doggy style. They both agree that this was just lust, they got it out of their system and they have to move on with their lives and won't see each other again. Stephanie moves out of the Denver house and gets back on the road on her motorcycle heading further West.
