Patsy's Holes Filled in Mini Golf (ENF, Reluctant Exhibitionist, MILF, Gangbang, Whore, CFNF, Only one naked)
My name is Patsy Barrett. I am the 43, year-old wife of Connor Barrett. My best friend is Trixie Fuller, my next-door neighbor. I have long blonde hair and blue eyes and very large breasts that too often attract attention. I am modest in my dress, but somehow I keep ending up naked in public. It embarrasses me, but my friends and family find it funny. Like the other day...
This one was entirely my idea and my fault, but it seemed like a good idea at the time. I had never been golfing. I asked Connor and Trixie to go miniature golfing at the local clubhouse with me because I thought it would be a fun way to spend the afternoon. Trixie, being the adventurous soul that she is, happily agreed.
Trixie said she would help me pick out an outfit that was suitable for golfing. I gratefully accepted her help because, let's face it, fashion has never been my strong suit. Since it was a sunny day, she picked out a skirt that was dangerously short, barely covering my bottom. She said something about how the breeze would help keep me cool while swinging those clubs around. And as if that wasn't enough, she paired it with a crop top halter with spaghetti straps that left very little to the imagination.
She pointed out that the more skin I had exposed to the air, the more comfortable I would be during our game of miniature golf in this scorching weather. I thanked her for helping me be more comfortable. Trixie is always looking out for me.
As we made our way to the miniature golf course, I could feel everyone's eyes on us, or rather on me and my scandalous attire. It made me a little nervous about my clothes, but I trusted Trixie's advice.
"Wow, my love," Connor whispered in my ear, "You're really turning heads today."
"You think so?" I blushed, glancing down at my outfit.
"Yeah," he grinned. "I mean, look at you. That outfit shows off all that hard work you've put into staying fit, those toned arms and legs from all that exercise. And judging by the looks we're getting from the other golfers, I'd say they're quite impressed too."
I blushed, thankful for his sweet words but feeling self-conscious. "Thanks," I replied with a shy smile. "I guess Trixie knows what she's doing when it comes to picking outfits."
We approached the club rental counter and picked up our golf balls. Trixie then led me towards a rack of golf clubs nearby.
"Alright, bestie," she said, "Now it's time for us to find you the right length club."
As I tried out a club, I must have accidentally backed into Trixie. To my horror, Trixie's club got caught on the back of my scandalously short skirt.
I froze in place, my eyes widening as I felt the club lift the hem of my skirt. Panic surged through me as I realized that I wasn't wearing any panties underneath this barely there skirt. I could feel the eyes of all the other golfers on my exposed flesh. Trixie's clever suggestion to help keep cool suddenly seemed like a terrible idea.
The realization that every single person around us had a clear view of my bare bottom sent a mix of embarrassment and arousal coursing through me.
Trixie gasped beside me, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.
"Oh no, bestie, I'm so sorry!" she exclaimed.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity but was probably only a few seconds, Trixie managed to untangle the club from my skirt.
"There we go!" she exclaimed cheerfully while giving me a playful pat on the ass. "All set now!"
I blushed furiously at her touch and pulled down my skirt hastily, attempting to regain some semblance of modesty. But deep down inside, there was a part of me that relished this unexpected display of exhibitionism.
Trixie threw her arms around me playfully. "Come on now, bestie! Let's show these boys what we're made of!"
Unable to resist Trixie's infectious energy, we headed towards the first hole amidst stares and whispers from nearby players.
The First Hole
At the first hole, Connor, always the gentleman, gestured for Trixie and me to go first. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to approach this unfamiliar game.
Trixie nudged me with her elbow and gave me an encouraging smile. "Go on, bestie," she said. "Show them what you're made of."
I took a deep breath and bent over to place my ball on the ground. It was then that I realized my skirt had once again lifted up, exposing my bare bottom to anyone who happened to be watching.
Trixie's eyes widened as she noticed my predicament. "Oh, bestie," she said. "You really have no luck when it comes to keeping that skirt down."
I stood up and shot her an embarrassed glance but tried to laugh at the absurdity of it all. "Seems like I'm destined to give everyone an eyeful today," I replied.
To keep my skirt covering my bottom, I squatted down to place my ball on the ground.
Trixie scolded me. "Oh no, bestie! Golfers aren't allowed to squat. It's not dignified."
"She's right," Connor chimed in. "We must maintain proper golf etiquette."
Reluctantly, I straightened up from my squatting position and glanced at Trixie expectantly for guidance.
"Now then," Trixie said. "Bend over at the waist."
I hesitated for a moment, my mind racing with conflicting thoughts. The idea of bending over in front of Connor and Trixie and everyone was humiliating. But I had to follow the rules.
Reluctantly, I took a deep breath and slowly bent over at the waist, feeling the fabric of my scandalously short skirt lift up once again over my bare bottom.
I could feel my cheeks burning with embarrassment as I placed the golf ball on the ground in front of me.
"Move it left a few inches," Trixie instructed helpfully.
Reluctantly, I shifted the ball slightly to the left as directed by Trixie. But before I could straighten up, she interrupted me once more.
"Nope," she said. "Too far to the left now."
I bit down on my lip nervously as I moved the ball back near its original position. It took a minute of moving it back and forth until Trixie deemed it just right. But I knew Trixie was just trying to help me learn to play golf.
Finally satisfied, Trixie nodded approvingly. "Perfect!" she exclaimed.
I straightened up from my bent over position and quickly pulled down my skirt to cover my bottom once again.
We played the hole, and to my surprise, I managed to take only three strokes to get the ball in the hole.
Trixie clapped her hands. "Well, well, bestie," she said. "Looks like you've got hidden talents after all. Who would've thought?"
I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride at my unexpected success.
Before we moved on to the next hole, it was time for me to pick up my ball. I hesitated for a moment before bending over, knowing full well that this would expose my bottom yet again.
"Bestie," Trixie called out. "Since you won the hole, you're supposed to get everyone's balls."
My eyes widened in disbelief as I turned towards her with a mixture of hesitation and reluctance.
"Are you serious?" I asked incredulously.
Trixie nodded enthusiastically. "Absolutely! Only one person picks up all the balls," she replied.
I sighed heavily but knew there was no arguing with Trixie's knowledge of the rules. Reluctantly, I bent over once again and started picking up all three balls from the cup.
The golfers around us watched with amusement as I awkwardly reached for the balls one by one. The embarrassment burned within me as their gazes lingered on my exposed bottom while I did it.
The Second Hole
At the second hole, Connor said "You got lucky on that first hole, my love. I'll show you how it's done on this one."
Trixie, always ready to defend my honor, jumped in immediately.
"Oh please," she scoffed. "Bestie here is a natural born golfer. I bet she'll beat you again."
"Is that so?" Connor asked. "Well then, let's make things interesting. If I win this round, Patsy will have to flash me her breasts."
My eyes widened in shock as his words hung in the air between us. The audacity of his bet left me momentarily speechless.
Trixie agreed before I could respond. "She'll take that bet. Don't worry, bestie, I know you're going to win this one easily. Show him what women athletes are capable of."
"Fine," I said, with foolish confidence.
I bent over from the waist placing my ball on the ground. When I straightened up from the ground, I saw a man nearby with his phone out. Had he taken a picture of my bottom while I was bent over? The thought distracted me, causing my focus on the game to waver.
With shaky hands gripping the club tightly, I swung at the ball with more force than finesse. My aim was completely off, sending it careening off the green.
Trixie burst into laughter behind me as she witnessed my terrible golfing skills unravel before her eyes. "Oh bestie," she said between fits of giggles. "Looks like your hidden talents are staying well hidden on this hole."
I retrieved the ball, feeling a mix of embarrassment and frustration. It took me four more strokes to finish the hole. I had lost.
Connor was grinning from ear to ear, clearly delighted with my loss.
"Well, well," he said. "Looks like you're not as good as you thought, my love."
I shot him a glare but it didn't matter how embarrassed or hesitant I felt; I had lost my bet.
"Do you really want me to do it?" I asked.
Connor's grin widened. "I really want you to flash me your breasts."
I reached down and hesitantly lifted my shirt just enough to expose a glimpse of skin. My heart raced in anticipation as Connor's eyes focused on my chest.
"You didn't lift it high enough, I couldn't see your nipples," he said.
A flush of heat rose to my cheeks at his comment. I took a deep breath and lifted my shirt all the way up, holding it in place.
"There you go," I said. "Happy now?"
Connor's eyes lingered on my exposed breasts, a smirk playing on his lips. "Oh, I'm more than happy," he replied. "But you know what would make me even happier? If I took a photo and posted it on Facebook to show everyone what a good sport you are."
My heart skipped a beat at the thought of my bare chest being shared with the world. The embarrassment washed over me once again as I noticed that the other golfers had their phones out, ready to capture this humiliating moment.
I hesitated for a moment, feeling hesitation and reluctance. But deep down, there was also an undeniable thrill coursing through my veins. As much as I hated to admit it, there was a part of me that reveled in this exhibitionistic display.
"Fine," I said, trying to mask any hint of excitement that may have slipped through. "Take your photo."
Connor wasted no time in raising his phone and capturing the image before I could change my mind.
As he lowered his phone with a satisfied grin, he turned towards me and said smugly, "Now everyone will see how much fun we're having today."
The other golfers were snapping their own photos. It seemed like they were all eager to capture this scandalous event. A flush of heat rose to my cheeks and I quickly pulled my shirt over my breasts.
"Wait a minute," Trixie said. "Bestie, you forgot to pick up the balls."
I groaned inwardly at her words, knowing full well what they meant. With a sinking feeling in my stomach, I bent over at the waist and reached for the golf balls.
As I picked up each ball one by one, I could feel the cameras clicking away furiously, capturing every inch of my bare bottom on display for all to see. The humiliation was overwhelming, yet somehow arousing at the same time.
When I finally stood up and smoothed down my skirt, Trixie said. "You know, you really do have a great ass."
I blushed with pride.
The Third Hole
On the third hole, Trixie declared with the utmost confidence that the last hole was a fluke and that I would surely win this one.
"Alright, bestie!" Trixie proclaimed, "This hole is yours for the taking."
Wanting to believe in myself, I agreed with Trixie's declaration.
"You're right, Trixie," I said firmly, my competitive fire igniting. "I've got this. Connor won't know what hit him."
"You know what? Let's make things even more interesting," Connor said. "If you lose this hole, my love, you'll have to take off your shirt."
The thought of baring myself for everyone to see sent shivers down my spine. How could I possibly agree to such a scandalous bet?
Trixie shot me an encouraging smile as she sensed my hesitation. "You'll do great, bestie."
Her words stirred a flicker of defiance in me, a part that refused to back down from a challenge.
So, with a mix of hesitation and reluctance, I took a deep breath and agreed to the bet.
All of the other golfers had gathered around, their eyes filled with anticipation and excitement. I noticed they were all standing behind me as I placed my ball on the ground. The weight of their gazes bore down on me. My hands trembled slightly as I positioned myself for the shot, trying to push aside any doubts that threatened to consume me.
With a determined focus, I swung the club with precision and skill. The ball stopped just inches away from the hole. Another putt and the ball was in the hole. A wave of relief washed over me as I realized how well I had played this round.
But Connor, Connor was something else entirely. He stepped forward confidently, his smug grin widening as he lined up his shot. And then it happened, a flawless swing that sent the ball dropping neatly into the hole.
The crowd erupted into cheers and applause while Connor did a little victory dance, reveling in his triumph like a cocky peacock strutting its feathers. His eyes locked onto mine as he approached me with an air of arrogance.
"Good hole," he said with mock sincerity, "but not good enough. And here's where your good sportsmanship comes into play. You know you lost fair and square. So pay up, my love."
Blushing, I slowly pulled off my shirt. The gathered golfers erupted into applause, or should I say the quiet golf clap? Of course they did.
My hands instinctively flew up to cover my bare breasts as embarrassment washed over me once again. But I realized I couldn't keep them there and play golf at the same time. Reluctantly, I pulled my hands away, exposing my breasts fully to everyone present. I could feel the cool breeze on my already painfully hard nipples.
Trixie was right, wearing less did keep me cooler.
The Fourth Hole
A mix of embarrassment and exhilaration coursed through me as I made my way towards the fourth hole with my swaying bare breasts on full display.
I was determined not to make another bet that would further humiliate myself. I would focus all of my energy on playing well and proving that I was more than just a source of entertainment for the leering spectators.
"Do you want your shirt back?" Connor asked, waving it in the air.
"Of course I do," I replied, crossing my arms over my bare chest. "But if you're offering it as a consolation prize for being such a terrible golfer, then maybe I'll pass."
Connor flashed me a grin. "Oh, my love, always the comedian. But here's the deal," he said, stepping closer to me with a mischievous glint in his eye. "I'll bet you your shirt against your skirt that you can't make hole four in under five strokes."
I raised an eyebrow at him, feeling both insulted and intrigued by his challenge. Did he really think so little of my golfing abilities? Or perhaps he was just being nice and giving me a chance to win my shirt back.
Either way, I couldn't resist the opportunity to prove him wrong. With a smirk of my own, I nodded and accepted his bet. "You're on," I said confidently.
At the fourth hole, excitement bubbled within me despite the lingering sense of hesitation and reluctance. The crowd of spectators had grown larger, their cameras flashing relentlessly as they captured every scandalous moment.
I positioned myself on the tee box with newfound determination coursing through my veins. My grip tightened around the club as I focused on the task at hand, proving to Connor and everyone else that I was more than just a pair of bare breasts.
That's when I saw the windmill. To get to the cup, the ball had to go through a windmill. Seriously? Who comes up with these absurd obstacles for a golf course?
Trixie nudged me playfully with her elbow. "Don't worry, bestie," she said. "You can do this."
It was moments like that when I truly valued our friendship and Trixie's unwavering support.
I took a deep breath and tried to steady my nerves as I faced the windmill. The blades were spinning ominously, their sharp edges glinting in the sunlight. It felt like they were mocking me, daring me to miss and humiliate myself even further.
With a shaky grip on my club, I swung with all my might. The ball rolled across the green, heading straight for the opening between two blades, and then it hit one of them square on. Oops!
The ball bounced back towards me, mocking my feeble attempt. A collective gasp rippled through the crowd as disappointment washed over me.
I gritted my teeth and tried again. Swing after swing, each one filled with determination and frustration in equal measure. This was turning into more of a comedy show than an actual golf game. Finally, on my fifth stroke, I managed to navigate past those treacherous blades and into the hole.
At first glance I thought that I had won, triumphantly proving Connor wrong once again. But then it hit me. I had bet that I could do it in under five strokes! Darn!
I took a deep breath, trying to muster up the courage to follow through with the bet. I had lost fair and square, and now it was time to pay up. My mind raced as I considered the consequences of my defeat. I was already topless, thanks to the last hole. How much worse would it be to be completely naked in front of all these people?
I looked around at all of the other golfers who had gathered around. Their eyes were fixed on me, their gazes filled with anticipation and curiosity. They were all waiting for me to strip down.
With a mix of hesitation and reluctance, I reached down and slowly began unzipping my skirt. The fabric slid down my legs until it pooled around my ankles. There I stood, naked in a public miniature golf course wearing only my stiletto shoes.
A round of applause erupted from the audience, or should I say another round of golf claps?
The cool breeze caressed every inch of exposed skin as I made my way towards the next hole. Self consciousness mingled with exhilaration within me as each step brought me closer to completing this humiliating round of golf.
The Fifth Hole
Connor said smugly. "Well, my love, if you don't have anything left to bet, maybe it's time you admit defeat."
His arrogant tone ignited a fire within me that refused to be extinguished.
I retorted, "Oh really? You think I'm just going to give up? Not a chance."
"Maybe you shouldn't bet on the fifth hole," Trixie said.
I knew she was right, but Connor's smugness fueled my determination even further.
"No," I said firmly while looking directly at Connor. "We're betting on this hole too."
"Alright then," he said. "What do you have left to bet?"
"I'll bet my shoes," I declared, pointing down at the stiletto heels on my feet, my only remaining clothing.
Connor scanned my body from head to toe appreciatively. I squirmed with pleasure under my husband's lustful gaze.
"You know," he said with a wicked grin, "I think you look better in those shoes than without them."
"I'll tell you what," Trixie interjected. "Since bestie here is running out of clothes to lose, how about she bets a performance, instead?"
My eyes widened as her suggestion sank in. A performance? What exactly did she have in mind? The possibilities raced through my mind, singing? dancing? Or something even more scandalous?
Before I could protest or ask for clarification, Connor eagerly agreed to Trixie's proposition.
"Fine," I said reluctantly. "A performance it is."
Trixie grinned and whispered in my ear, "Don't worry bestie, we'll figure something out." Her words offered little comfort as images of embarrassing scenarios flashed through my mind.
As we approached the next hole, anxiety gnawed at me like a persistent itch beneath my skin. What had I gotten myself into? But there was no turning back now; I had made the bet and would have to follow through.
The crowd gathered around us grew larger with each passing moment. It felt like the world had become one giant stage and all eyes were on me.
I lost, of course.
I couldn't hit the golf ball straight to save my life or my dignity. So, there I was, standing in the middle of a miniature golf course, completely naked except for my stiletto heels. And now Connor wanted me to perform as part of our bet.
"What kind of performance do you want?" I asked him with a mix of hesitation and reluctance. I braced myself for his response, fully expecting something humiliating like karaoke.
To my surprise, Connor said, "How about a demonstration of your fitness? Let's see how many jumping jacks you can do."
Jumping jacks? Seriously? Out of all the things he could have chosen, he wanted me to bounce around like a cheerleader? It was almost comical how normal and mundane his request sounded compared to what I had anticipated.
"Fine," I declared. "I'll do the jumping jacks."
Connor wasted no time pulling out his phone and positioning himself to capture every embarrassing moment on video. He grinned like a maniac as he aimed the camera at me.
As I began the jumping jacks, I couldn't ignore the sensation that accompanied each jump. My breasts, larger than I'd like to admit, bounced with a mind of their own. The weight of them tugged at my chest, a constant reminder of my situation.
But it wasn't just me who felt it. I could feel the eyes of the crowd that had gathered to watch. Their stares were focused on my bouncing breasts, and I felt a flush of embarrassment.
But there was a defiance building within me. Despite the embarrassment, despite the discomfort, I was determined to finish what I'd started. I wanted to prove to myself that I could handle this, that I could rise above the awkwardness and the self consciousness.
With every jump and spread of my legs apart, my breasts bounced up and down in an indecent display that made even Trixie blush from the sidelines. It was mortifying, being exposed like this while Connor streamed it all on Facebook for everyone to see. But I was resolute, jumping until I was out of breath, until the flush of defiance overpowered the heat of embarrassment.
As I finally slowed down and caught my breath, the crowd broke into a golf clap. Amidst the embarrassment and humiliation, there was a flicker of pride. I had not only completed the challenge I'd been given, but I had also managed to impress those who had been watching.
The Sixth Hole
When we got to the sixth hole, I declared that I would not bet. The humiliation and embarrassment of my previous performance were still fresh in my mind, and I couldn't bear the thought of subjecting myself to another embarrassing display.
Connor looked disappointed. "Aww, my love," he said playfully. "I was hoping for another chance to see your athletic skills on display."
I blushed at his words and couldn't help feeling a sense of pride that he still found me desirable. And I was happy to make my husband proud of me and my fit body, even if it meant subjecting myself to public nudity and bouncing boobs.
I told my husband, "Alright then, let's make a bet."
His eyes lit up with excitement as he eagerly asked, "What are you willing to wager?"
Trixie pointed and said "this is an easy hole, bestie."
I could see the hole just a few feet away from where we stood, it seemed so easy to hit the ball into it.
I said, "How about this, if I can't make it in two strokes or less, you get to choose any punishment you want."
Connor raised an eyebrow suggestively as he considered my proposal. His gaze lingered on my naked body for a moment longer than necessary before he grinned wickedly.
"Deal," he said.
Holding my breath, I swung the club. The ball headed straight towards the hole. My heart raced as time seemed to slow down for just a moment. And then, Thunk!
The sound echoed through the air as my ball sank into the hole in one glorious stroke. A wave of triumph washed over me.
"Hooray!" I shouted, pumping my fist into the air triumphantly. "In your face!"
I danced around Connor in mock celebration, reveling in my victory and relishing every ounce of satisfaction that came with it.
"Oh yeah! Who's the champ now?" I taunted playfully while doing an improvised victory dance.
Just as I was dancing triumphantly naked on the golf course, for a moment not caring who saw me, Trixie's voice called out. "Hold your horses, bestie," she said. "You haven't won just yet."
Confusion washed over me as I followed her gaze to where the ball had disappeared. My heart plummeted as I realized she was right, there it was, rolling out of a tube on another part of the green below.
Rats! I cursed myself internally for my foolishness. Who designs these crazy holes?
With one shot left to win my bet, my nerves took hold of me. My hands trembled slightly as I lined up my aim.
I swung carefully, watching anxiously as the ball rolled along. But instead of rolling into the hole, it stopped just inches from it.
"Double rats!" I muttered under my breath, resisting the urge to throw my club across the green in frustration.
Connor blushed more than I did when he named his prize. The performance he wanted was a blow job. My eyes widened in shock as he pointed to the bulge in his pants, explaining that he had been sporting an erection since the first hole and needed some relief.
I hesitated, my mind racing with conflicting thoughts. This was not what I had expected when agreeing to the bet. But then again, I couldn't shake the guilt of getting him hard for so long. It must hurt, and it was my fault, after all. And I loved giving my husband blow jobs.
With a sigh of resignation, I looked up at Connor and said with a mix of reluctance and empathy, "Alright, fine. I'll do it."
I tried to ignore the crowd of golfers around us as I knelt down in front of him and unzipped his pants. His hard cock sprang free.
I could feel my own hesitation mingling with arousal as I took him into my mouth. The taste of him filled my senses, salty and musky, as I began to suck him eagerly.
Connor moaned softly above me, his fingers tangling in my hair as he guided me gently back and forth along his length. The sounds of pleasure escaped from his lips like music to my ears.
My tongue danced around the head of his cock, then I sucked it deep into my throat. As Connor grew closer to climax, his grip tightened on my hair almost possessively. His breathing became erratic, matching the rhythm of my mouth working tirelessly on his throbbing member.
Finally, with a guttural groan escaping his lips, Connor reached his peak. Hot spurts flooded into my mouth as I swallowed eagerly, savoring the taste of my husband's cum.
I stood up, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand as I licked the remnants of his cum from my lips. My mind was still spinning from the intensity of the moment, but a part of me couldn't help feeling a sense of satisfaction. I had done it, fulfilled my end of the bet and brought Connor to a climax that left him breathless.
I declared in a firm tone, "No more bets."
But just as I thought this bet had reached its conclusion, Trixie pointed to the gathered crowd that had been watching our little escapade with rapt attention. They were all men, their eyes filled with desire and their bulges growing more prominent by the second.
"Looks like you've caused quite a stir," Trixie said. "All these men have erections thanks to you. Care to take care of them too?"
My face flushed crimson at the realization that not only had I exposed myself in such an intimate act with Connor but also inadvertently turned on so many others around us. The attention made me feel both exhilarated and embarrassed at once. It was thrilling to know that I could still excite so many men, yet daunting to think about what they might expect from me.
Hesitation gnawed at me as conflicting thoughts swirled in my mind. Should I indulge these men's desires? Was it fair for them to expect anything more from me?
I hesitated for a moment, my mind caught between the thrill of the attention and the nagging reluctance that still lingered within me. The crowd of men continued to watch with hungry eyes, their bulges growing more pronounced by the second.
But then again, who was I to deny them? After all, I had willingly sucked off Connor, satisfying his desires in exchange for my own foolish bet. And now here I stood, surrounded by a group of eager onlookers who were undoubtedly hoping for a taste of what they had witnessed.
A wicked smirk tugged at the corners of my lips as an idea formed in my mind, another bet. Perhaps it was the adrenaline coursing through my veins or simply my own twisted sense of curiosity that led me down this path once again. But one thing was certain: if Connor wanted to play this game, then so be it.
"Alright," I said with mock confidence as I locked eyes with him. "If you win the next hole. I'll give a blow job to a spectator for each stroke you beat me by."
Connor's eyebrows shot up in surprise, his lips curling into a mischievous grin. "Oh really?" he replied, his voice playful. "You sure about that?"
"Absolutely," I replied.
The Seventh Hole
With a cocky swagger in his step, Connor stepped up to take his shot on the seventh hole. The crowd watched intently as he swung his club with practiced precision and sent the ball rolling.
Connor's ball bounded off a wall, expertly maneuvering around a miniature castle, bounced off another wall before finally landing with a rattle in the hole. The crowd clapped politely at first and then erupted into cheers and applause, their eyes filled with anticipation.
Trixie, standing by the hole, looked at me. " Connor just hit a hole in one. Sorry to say, bestie, but it seems like you're about to lose this bet."
My heart sank as I watched my own ball ricochet off the castle walls and roll pathetically away from the hole. It took me six agonizing strokes to finally sink it.
"I'm sorry," Trixie said sadly. "But that means you owe the spectators five blow jobs." She gestured towards the crowd of men who were now watching us expectantly, their bulges growing more prominent by the second.
As I scanned the eager faces in front of me, hesitation gnawed at my gut like an insatiable hunger. How was I supposed to choose which men would receive these blow jobs? Which men would I take into my mouth and which men would I disappoint?
The crowd of men before me looked eager and hungry, their eyes fixed on me as if I were some kind of sexual delicacy. It was both exhilarating and daunting to be the center of such desire.
I turned to Trixie for help, "Can you help me choose?"
Without missing a beat, Trixie called out for the men to form a line if they wanted to receive one of my blow jobs. Almost every man eagerly stepped forward..
Trixie scanned the line of hopefuls before picking out five particularly handsome men.
"Alright," she grinned, "you, you, you, you, and definitely you, step forward, please."
The chosen men stepped forward.
Trixie declared, "Congratulations, gentlemen! You're about to get a blow job from Patsy and become the stars of our impromptu photo shoot."
As Trixie took out her phone to capture the momentous occasion, I knelt down on the ground in front of the first man in line. His cock stood erect and throbbing with anticipation as he awaited my attention.
Without hesitation or reluctance this time, I took him into my mouth, savoring his taste as I bobbed back and forth along his length. Trixie positioned herself strategically beside us, expertly capturing each salacious moment on her phone.
When the man came, he pulled his cock out of my mouth and sprayed hot cum all over my hair and face. The crowd clapped and laughed as Trixie captured the moment in a photo, her mischievous grin widening.
"Alright, boys! Make sure you post those photos online with the tag 'patsybarrett'," Trixie called out to the eager onlookers. "Let's make sure everyone knows just how much Patsy loves a good facial!"
My face flushed crimson at Trixie's sarcastic comment. She knew that I already had countless embarrassing photos that had made their way online.
When I finished sucking all five men, I was dripping with cum. It ran down my face and breasts, leaving a sticky trail of evidence that showcased just how much these strangers had enjoyed my skills. With a mixture of reluctance and arousal, I wiped the cum off my nose and licked my finger, savoring the taste. At least cum was delicious.
I stood up, feeling a strange mix of satisfaction and degradation as the crowd erupted into applause. Their golf claps filled the air, mocking me for willingly subjecting myself to this debauchery. But deep down, I couldn't deny that there was something thrilling about being objectified like this.
As they snapped photos of me, I couldn't help but feel a twisted sense of pride. If they were going to take pictures of me covered in cum, then damn it, I wanted to look good, or as good as one could while drenched in sticky white fluid. I smiled my biggest smile and posed.
The Eighth Hole
Connor looked at me with a grin. "My love," he said, "this next hole we're going to up the stakes a bit."
I blinked in surprise, not realizing we were still betting on each hole. But as I glanced around at the expectant faces of the crowd, I couldn't deny that everyone seemed to assume we were.
My mind raced trying to remember if I had agreed to this and simply forgotten. Feeling a little silly for not paying attention earlier, I decided to just go along with it.
Connor explained the new rules of our bet. "For each stroke you lose on this hole," he declared, "one of the crowd gets to fuck you."
The words sent shivers down my spine. I looked at my husband and saw a mix of pride and love in his eyes. He loved me and my body so much that he wanted to share me with the world, even if it meant embarrassing me in front of a crowd.
The thought of multiple strangers penetrating me was both thrilling and terrifying. But deep down, there was also an undeniable arousal building within me, a hunger for something daring and forbidden. I nodded slowly, accepting the terms of our outrageous bet.
As we approached the tee box for the eighth hole, I took a deep breath, trying to calm the nervous flutter in my stomach. My hands trembled as I placed the golf ball on the tee. I remembered when exposing my ass had been my biggest worry.
I steadied myself and swung the club. The ball rolled up the slope and straight for the hole! But I had hit it too hard; it rolled over the hole and down the other side of the hill. Rats!
I tried again, this time hitting it more softly, but with not enough force to get it up the little hill.
My frustration grew. It felt like every stroke was one step closer to giving my body to these strangers.
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of missed putts, I managed to sink the ball into the hole. The crowd erupted into applause.
"Well, my love, it looks like you're seven strokes behind," Connor said.
Trixie already had a group of men eagerly lined up at her command. Their pants were already discarded, revealing bulges that strained against their underwear. Trixie must have chosen them specifically for their very large cocks.
"Alright boys," Trixie said, "let's show Patsy here just what she's been missing out on."
The men grinned hungrily in response as they stepped forward one by one.
My heart raced as I glanced at Connor for reassurance. He smiled lovingly at me, he was enjoying every moment of this debauchery.
With a mixture of reluctance and arousal coursing through my veins, I lowered myself onto the putting green and spread my legs wide open. There was no turning back now; I had willingly agreed to be fucked by these strangers.
The first man wasted no time plunging into me with a thick cock that sent shockwaves of pleasure through my body. Each subsequent thrust pushed me closer to the edge of ecstasy. His relentless thrusts sent waves of pleasure coursing through me, but too soon he pulled out and sprayed his cum on my body.
It wasn't enough. I was so close to the edge, desperate for release, yet still unfulfilled. My body ached with need.
"Please," I begged. "I need more. I need someone to make me cum."
Trixie giggled from behind her phone, capturing every humiliating moment with delight. "Oh bestie," she said, "you're such a greedy little slut. But don't worry, we'll find someone who can give you what you want."
Another man stepped forward from the eager lineup. His cock glistened with precum as he positioned himself between my trembling legs.
As his thick shaft slid into me, filling the void left by the previous men, a surge of pleasure shot through my body like an electric shock. The intensity was overwhelming as he fucked me, but he too pulled out too soon, spraying his cum on my body.
It still wasn't enough.
"Please," I begged. "Fuck my pussy. Cum inside me. Fuck me 'til I cum."
Two more men followed suit, each taking their turn to ravage my aching pussy until I thought I couldn't take anymore. Their grunts mingled with my moans as they mercilessly fucked me towards oblivion.
And then, with the last thick cock inside me, it happened. With one final deep thrust, everything inside of me unraveled in an explosion of pure bliss. My body convulsed uncontrollably as orgasm after orgasm slammed into me..
When I finally came down from the euphoric high, my body still trembling with aftershocks, I slowly opened my eyes to see the crowd around me. Their faces were filled with a mix of awe and arousal as they watched me, covered in sweat and cum, basking in the aftermath of such intense pleasure.
"Well " Connor said, smiling at me. "I wonder how you can top this for the next hole."
With a sigh of reluctance and desire, but mostly desire, I thought of a way to top this. I couldn't help but feel a surge of mixed emotions, excitement and hesitation warring within me once again. The thought of having strangers penetrate my ass was both thrilling and terrifying. Thrilling won.
"Fine," I said defiantly while biting back a smirk. "Every stroke I lose by on the ninth hole, one of these guys will earn them the privilege of fucking my tight little asshole."
Connor's grin widened as he looked at the eager lineup behind him, men who were already rubbing their hands together in anticipation or adjusting their bulges that strained against their pants.
"Oh my love," he said. "I've never loved you more."
The Ninth Hole
As I stepped up to take my turn on the ninth hole, the silence was deafening. The only sound was the gentle rustle of leaves in the breeze and the soft click of my club hitting the ball. My heart raced as I swung, feeling the weight of Connor's gaze upon me.
The crowd watched with bated breath. I knew what they wanted, to see me humiliated and degraded by their lust for my body. And yet a part of me craved it too.
As I looked down at the ball, I felt a sudden burst of excitement coursing through me. This was it, this was my chance to get fucked by all these eager men. I wanted to be fucked, hard and dirty, until there was nothing left but raw pleasure coursing through every inch of my being.
I deliberately played badly, intentionally hitting the ball past the hole. I hit it too hard. I hit it too soft. With each missed putt, my body thrummed with excitement at what lay ahead, cocks filling every hole imaginable until I could take no more. My score kept getting higher and higher, but so did my arousal.
Finally, I hit the ball into the hole with a grin on my face. I wanted to get the fucking started.
Trixie declared that I had lost by sixty-eight strokes. She couldn't help but add a playful twist to our debauchery, suggesting we make it sixty-nine.
I glanced at Connor, his eyes filled with amusement and desire. "Agreed. They can all get a piece of my ass this time."
Trixie wasted no time lining up the men from the ever-growing throng who had gathered around us. They stepped forward confidently, their gazes fixed on me with hungry anticipation. As they approached, I felt a surge of both excitement and lust ripple through me.
"Gentlemen," Trixie announced loudly enough for everyone to hear, "it's time to learn how much Patsy here can handle."
The men eagerly crowded around me as Trixie snapped pictures with her phone.
I hesitated for just a moment before giving into my desires, dropping down onto all fours with eager anticipation.
The first man stepped forward, his cock already hard and ready for action. Trixie conveniently had a bottle of lube and lathered it on his cock. She is always looking out for me.
The man then wasted no time plunging into my ass. I gasped at the sudden sensation of being filled so completely. Then I felt a cock slip into my pussy. The feeling was overwhelming, pleasure mingling seamlessly with pain as they pounded into me mercilessly in both. But it wasn't enough; I wanted more.
A cock appeared in front of my face, its owner urging me to take it in my mouth. Without hesitation, I eagerly took it between my lips, savoring the taste of delicious cum on my tongue once again.
With each passing moment, I could feel myself spiraling further and further out of control, lost in a sea of pleasure that threatened to consume me entirely. It was as if nothing else mattered except this intense desire coursing through every inch of my being.
Then the cock pulled out of my mouth and sprayed cum all over my face and hair. The sheer humiliation of having him cum on my face was enough to send me over the edge and I came, screaming out my orgasm.
As they continued to fuck me relentlessly, I reached out eagerly towards any cock that came within reach, taking them greedily into my mouth, wanting another taste of delicious cum. I swallowed what I could, but many pulled out of and added their cum to my face, hair, and tits.
I was being used in all three holes and felt like a total slut. And yet it felt wonderful.
As one man after another took turns fucking me senseless, Connor watched from the sidelines with a smirk on his face. It was clear he enjoyed watching me lose control under such debauchery, relishing every moan and whimper that escaped my lips.
There was an undeniable thrill coursing through every inch of my body. I knew what this made me look like; dirty and depraved beyond belief, but at that moment, I didn't care about anything other than getting fucked until I couldn't take it anymore.
As the last man finally finished with a grunt of satisfaction and pulled out from between my legs, Trixie approached us once again with her camera lens trained on our faces.
"That was quite the show," she declared with glee. "Maybe next time we can try something even more daring."
The Tenth Hole
I scoffed at Trixie's suggestion, "Next time?" I said. "There won't be a next time. That was the last hole and my last bet."
Trixie just grinned wickedly at me, her eyes glinting with mischief. "Oh come on bestie," she said. "You know you loved every dirty second of it."
I rolled my eyes at her words, but couldn't deny the truth buried within them, there was an undeniable thrill coursing through every inch of my body embarrassment.
Connor stepped forward then, his own smirk mirroring Trixie's.
"Actually," he said, "I bet you that this course has a tenth hole."
I raised an eyebrow skeptically at his words, already sensing some sort of trickery brewing beneath the surface.
I glanced around us, scanning for any sign that he might be telling the truth.
"You're pulling my leg," I said.
"I swear," said Connor.
Trixie chimed in, "Seems like Connor is pretty confident. Are you afraid to make a bet, Patsy? Another performance?"
I crossed my arms over my bare breasts. Trixie and Connor were known for their friendly wagers, and I'd seen Connor pull off some unbelievable tricks before. But I couldn't let him make a fool out of me.
"Fine," I said, my tone determined. "I'll take your bet, Connor."
Connor's grin widened, clearly pleased with himself for getting me to bite. My heart raced a bit faster. This was a bold bet, but I couldn't let Connor's confidence shake me. We shook on it, sealing the bet.
Connor led me off the golf course, his hand possessively gripping my waist as I made my way through the crowd naked in high heels, covered in cum. Cum oozed out of my pussy and dripped down my thighs, while more cum oozed out of my ass. The crowd followed eagerly behind us. I could feel their eyes on me.
As we approached the clubhouse, I noticed a neon sign bearing the name "The Tenth Hole". It was the name of the clubhouse bar. My heart sank as I realized that I had lost the bet.
"You think you're so clever," I said to Connor as we stepped inside, greeted by raucous laughter and applause.
Connor just grinned and said, "You love it."
He was right; despite everything, there was an undeniable thrill coursing through every inch of my body whenever my misadventures pushed me to my limits.
The crowd cheered loudly as we made our way inside, eager to see just how far I would go for their pleasure this time around.
Trixie made an announcement that left me feeling both excited and apprehensive all at once.
"Ladies and gentlemen," she announced loudly, her voice carrying above the din of conversation. "Welcome to The Tenth Hole, where anything goes. Or Patsy's three holes where anyone goes. I'd like you all to meet your naked server for the day. Patsy Barrett here will be delivering drinks or fucking for tips. And let me tell you folks, this girl is one hell of a fuck."
I blushed at her words and the crowd erupted into cheers and applause at her words. Their eyes filled with lustful anticipation as they eagerly reached into their wallets for cash. I felt a surge of both excitement and trepidation ripple through me at their attention.
Connor leaned in close to whisper, "You ready for this?"
I hesitated for just a moment before nodding eagerly, eager to see what sort of debauchery lay ahead.
And then it happened, one by one, men started approaching our table with offers of money for sex acts performed right there on top of it.
Before long, I was bent over the bar counter taking cocks from behind while others watched and groped me greedily. The sound of flesh slapping against flesh echoed through the air as I moaned in pleasure, lost in a sea of lust and desire.
As each man took his turn using me for his pleasure, the crowd around us grew more frenzied with excitement. They cheered and jeered as I moaned and whimpered under their relentless assault on my body.
But despite the humiliation and degradation I felt coursing through every inch of my being, there was an undeniable thrill that kept me going, an insatiable hunger for more cock that seemed impossible to quench.
For hours on end, I was fucked senseless on top of that bar, taking cocks deep inside every hole imaginable until there was nothing left but raw pleasure coursing through me, until finally the last man had finished with a satisfied grunt and spray of cum.
I tried to stand, but my legs were too weak to hold me up. I was trembling and exhausted from countless orgasms. I was drenched in cum from head to toe. Cum leaked out of my holes as I struggled to get back on my feet, feeling humiliated and degraded by what I had just done.
Trixie helped me up, her strong arms wrapping around me tightly.
"I love you, bestie" I muttered into her ear as she held me close, feeling grateful for her unwavering support throughout this entire misadventure.
Connor counted the money I had earned as a whore, his eyes gleaming with pride.
"You did good, my love," he murmured softly before pressing a kiss against my lips that left me reeling with pleasure despite everything.
Trixie's eyes glinted with mischief as she surveyed the crowd around us. "Well done bestie," she said. "You've certainly made quite a good whore."
I smiled at her words despite myself before turning to face the crowd once again, waving at them gamely even though every inch of my being was screaming out in shame.
But then something strange happened, instead of jeering or mocking me like I expected them to, they broke out into applause instead. Cameras flashed wildly as they captured every dirty moment for posterity, the naked woman who had fucked half the bar senseless.
And strangely enough, despite everything that had happened over the course of this insane day, all the humiliation and degradation that came along with it, there was an undeniable sense of pride coursing through every inch of my being.
As we made our way outside to a round of applause, I smiled and waved as they took photos of me, proud to be a whore who could satisfy so many people's desires with ease. It was an odd feeling; one that mixed both pride and humiliation together in equal measure.
As we walked away from The Tenth Hole towards our car parked nearby, Trixie turned towards me with a mischievous grin on her face.
"You're such a filthy little whore," she teased.
"I know," I said with a smirk on my face.
Connor laughed beside us before leaning in closer to add his own thoughts: "But you're my filthy little whore."
I blushed at his words even as a shiver coursed through every inch of my being in response to his touch.
"So," Trixie drawled teasingly. "When are we going miniature golfing again?"
"I don't know," I replied with a smirk. "Maybe next weekend."
