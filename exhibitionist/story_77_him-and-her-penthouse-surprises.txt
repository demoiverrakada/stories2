Him.
You flood my mind throughout the day...in and out of meetings, conference calls, deal-making...but it's all you. When I last left, you had no further agenda for the day, merely laying naked in the bed, the crisp white sheets barely draped over, covering only half of your ass...looking like a dream. And now...I stand in the elevator, scanning my card and taking the forever journey up to find you...so fucking needy for you*
Her.
I'd like to say I was productive... But actually, I lazed... Daydreamed... Took a bath... Stared out the window... Thought about you... I lied. There are clothes. But I prefer yours. I like smelling you on my skin. I glance at the clock and I know you're due...
And that's how I wait for you...
Your shirt skimming my bare skin
The room is dark... Just the city lighting up the room.
Him.
The ding of the elevator rings out after an eternity. And the first thing I see is darkness. Shapes furnish the room all in black. And the lit-up city is the most prominent visual. Floor to ceiling...a brilliant view. All until I catch your dark silhouette against the window, and the slight strip of white light from the outside...my shirt, hanging over your naked body.
My coat is shrugged...keys dropped...my determination to get over to you right away...carnal desire...burnt into my face as I stride towards you*
Her.
I don't turn... I just offer a soft tilt of my head. My hair falls to one side and my neck is left bare. Your shirt has fallen from one shoulder too, so makes skin is there for you, yours to touch... To taste... To have. I am not wearing anything underneath so your shirt just skims my ass... And I know how you like that ... So I stand on my tiptoes, legs tenses, my ass firm, and the hem grazes my mound, a constant reminder of my nakedness
Him.
My black tie still on tight, I step up behind you, taking notice of the small quick peeks that you allow your body to send me...seeing your nakedness, the thought of your skin, your fresh, bare ass, your naked, soft, and perfect pussy...your nipples hardened and poking through the thin shirt fabric...all of these images, thoughts, feelings...
They run straight into my cock. And he swells, at every thought of you. So abruptly that he can be felt snaking up the inside of your inner thigh behind my dress pants, pressed against you as my arms loop around and hands move up your chest, fingers pulling down at the open top edge of the shirt*
Her.
I stand still for a moment. Long eyelashes fluttering closed. My heart beats fast... My body changing... Awakening... Until I can't stand it... I need you. I turn... And whilst clothing may be lacking... The rest of me has been preened to perfection. Inky dark smudges make my ocean blue eyes pop. Red sultry lips that belong around your cock. Pretty plum nails... Matching toes. Hair falling in loose sexy curls. My skin is smoothed, lotioned, scented. Your finger drops from the collar...I step back so I rest against the window, and I flick the one closed button. With a roll... The crisp white shirt falls. Naked. The only thing on my body is the city lights... And your gaze.
Yours ❤️
Him.
Watching it all. Complete perfect. As I've come to know you. Fuck. I fucking need you. My eyes following your every move, the swell and rise of my cock so brazen and noticeable that there's nothing I could do to hide it. My deep brown eyes lock with yours, and I take a tiny step your way, my eyes never breaking now, my right hand just flipping my top button...the zip flying open just from the stretch of the fabric alone...
the thick base of my cock bending as I just thumb the pants down...raising my chin as I come within inches of your face*
Her.
My fingers reach forwards and with a short sharp tug, your shirt splits open. I let in gape as my fingers reach in, starting at your shoulders my nails rake down your skin... with 4 long red lines on each side... Over your broad chest, bumping over each rib, the dip of your stomach... And to your pants. I waste no time. the need is too much. A pull and they drop... Your cock sings as he's freed... And I lean forwards... But I don't kiss your lips...Instead... Your jaw... Neck... chest...And I slowly lower... Leaving a trail of perfect red lip marks on your skin.
Him.
I consider shrugging the shirt off...but I decided against it. Wanting you to feel it against your cheek, or your collarbone as I reach down to feel your skin. I know what's coming...and my cock does too...he looks right at you. My strong chest rises as your lips drag down my skin...and I spread my feet shoulder-width. My fingertips move to your body and let you fall as I press them against you, slowing bumping along the contour of your frame until they move in along your neckline and then feel your jaw slipping through them, and just before they clear it...you feel the tug, and lift your head up at my fingertip's command, looking up at me looking down."Show me what a good girl you are."
Her.
My gasp is loud. A jolt. You can do that in an instance. I am a good girl... I will be a good girl... But I've missed him... He needs special attention... "Hands... Or no hands...?"
Him.
"Start with no hands."
"And show me how much you've missed him."
Her.
My hands rest on the backs of your thighs, just above your knees, you feel my soft fingers against your skin. I settle into my knees, getting comfortable... My head lowers further to your inner thigh. That's where I start. Long lazy kisses along your skin. All the way up to your hip bone. You feel my hairbrush against your cock... But it's the only contact...
My mouth is occupied with your skin... Tasting, licking, biting.
Discovering every inch of you... But I'm never far...He can feel my breath, a glance of my chin, the sweep of my cheek as I inch closer... Closer
Him.
I feel a deep urge within to grab your head...to take you by force...but I stop myself, incredible restraint..." not yet", I think. But then your seductive dance begins...your hair is the first touch I notice... it's so soft and elegant in its loose curls. I feel the light touch of your purple fingernails against my thighs...not digging in but hopefully not for long. My expression, locked to yours, is that of strong control, but weakening...as my eyelids fall slightly... my teen gritting in a primal sneer. Pure desire.
Her.
My gaze rises... I know how slutty I look... Knelt for you, deep red lips eager and waiting... But my blue eyes don't blink once as my tongue extends, I don't need to look... I know... The very tip of my tongue makes contact with a sweep in a soft circle around your smooth pulsing head. He flexes at my touch and precum leaks... I beam... My first reward. My tongue is there, lapping, dipping into your slit to take every drop... Which I savor. Your taste... Mine.
Him.
I watch and wince as the cum soaks onto your tongue and you close your lips to complete the tasting. I want to give you so much more. So that's what I'll do. My fingers lift your jaw slightly...my thumb against your cheek...pushing so your mouth falls open, a bit wider with the motion. Your tongue slides out for another taste...and you pause as my hand moves to my girthy shaft...then the tapping of the thick under vein...against your tongue, tap tap tap tap... Every so often pulling him out and running the slit over your red lips...repeating this until I set him flat on your tongue and, looking down at you, give a slow single nod.*
Her.
"put your palms on the glass" I murmur before my lips pout... And rest flush against your tip. My nails grip your thighs a little tighter... Can you see that creamy smear of you against my sexy red fuckable lips... Do you want them... Does he need them... The nod. It's all I need. I lean back, moving away... But my fingers pull bringing you with me. They run up the backs of your thighs to grip your ass and my head rests against the glass. No, where to go. .
And you...
You can look out across the city... Top floor...
As I pull you into my mouth.
Him.
Fuck. My hands smack against the glass, it offers a low vibrating gong as the sound travels. But the next sound is your soft moan...and I feel that tug and then the warmth consume me. Fuck...My knees bend slightly...and I already begin to hold as I reach your throat...Pushing forward so your head feels the glass against your hair...pressing, your range of movement decreasing, my cock's throb, tightly against your throat, pulling all the way out...waiting for you to reach 3/4 of your gasp,then plunging in again.*
Her.
You can see my sexy red lips stretching, your length sliding in, filling my mouth, entering smooth but dry... That first pull out and he's coated... The second dripping ... As my hungry slutty mouth lubes him up with your precum and my saliva... You slide in easier, harder, deeper, your hips thrusting as you hold yourself over me. Looking down... Your slutty good girl servicing your cock just like he deserves, looking out... The city yours for the taking. You're so powerful, sexy... Your dick throbs in my throat. Each thrust is hard and unforgiving. And I love it. Need it
Him.
My knees bend even more, and each thrust is a roll upwards and forwards of my body, fucking your face, claiming your mouth as a perfect slut to service my overwhelming needs. Fuck you're such a good girl, reaching down, my palms squeeze your cheeks, holding your head absolutely still with force, and I thrust my cock in and out at a fast pace, as dripping webs of cum and saliva fall to your exposed breasts...as if they were aimed for your nipples... As you start to wear the sticky fruits of our lust*
Her.
My hands move from your ass... You don't need me to guide you, you know how to fuck my mouth just how you like. My fingers move to my breasts, smearing the strands of cum and saliva over my skin. I want to be slutty for you... I want to wear you...My tongue curls up firm on the underside of your cock... Teasing your throbbing vein as your head hits the beach of my throat... I gag, my body tenses... But I don't stop... You pause...letting me adjust and then you feel my suck, Needing to please you... Needing to adore every inch.
Him.
You can hear the tone of my voice change... Ffffff...fffffuck...I feel that heavy touch of your tongue as you curl around...my cockhead screaming with pleasure every time I thrust into you...Fucking your slutty mouth the way I'd fuck your tight cunt when we really had to let loose...fuck...fuck... You're so good, fuck you treat that cock so well... I'm gonna cum for you, baby...I can feel it...You suck me so fucking well, like a good slut and fuck...you're gonna get such a reward... Are you ready, dirty girl?
Her
I tilt my chin upwards, so you can fill my throat easier, so I can take your full length, not that you always give it... First short fast darts then long hard deep rolling thrusts... Pulling out to rim my swollen lips, to dribble your cum on them before you fuck me again. Your moans and grunts... Fuck they turn me on. My head pressed against the glass. I'm all yours... And I give you all I can... Never slowing or stopping
Him.
Jesus...My legs tense up...I can feel my balls rising... it's coming...My expression changing again to pure furious primal lust as I take what's mine. Your throat. Your mouth. And I feel that inner burst as I begin to tip over the edge...My hand moves to your hair...closing down on it hard, holding you right where I want you.Howling out as begin to cumFFFFuuuuuuk I'm cumming, baby...Fuck! It's all fucking yours
Her.
My hands rise too, cupping your balls so I feel them tense... Then release,You paint the back of my throat... Then as you pull out my hands take over... Milking you onto me...Hot spurts across my breasts, dripping from my nipples, over my skin
Him.
I howl out hard and loud...banging my fist against the glass as I release...and spurt after spurt arcs across you, my divine slut receiving your prize...fuck me, My hand tightens against your hair and I yank your head back...one final thrust before I leave your mouth...then continue to drizzle your body with my milky cum...With my forehead against the glass, I reach down and scoop you up by the underarms...lifting fast as you rise and my right hand swooping underneath you, pressed half on your left asscheek, the other three fingers pressed firmly against your naked and dripping mound, and spinning your body round to the small round table just a foot away from the window...your naked ass feels my hand underneath as I set you down...immediately imposing on you, my still hard but now dripping cock slipping right up between your folds and putting a sudden and intense pressure onto your clit almost immediately...as I slide him deep through your folds...feeling how wet you actually were down there*
Her.
Wet is an understatement... I'm dripping... I nearly came when you took my hair to fill my mouth. Your taste lingers, my skin is wet with you. I feel slutty. Dirty. Sexy.Watching your cock... Fuck it's so hot... So sexy
Him.
You slink back, with my body that crowds you...but one hand rests on the table behind you, giving you my arm to lean on. The other hand grabs you by the ankle, stretching your left knee up and placing the bottom of your left foot against my collarbone...your sexy nails on your curling toes as they stretch over my shoulder...
Looking down, I spit onto my right hand, onto four flat fingers, and reach down between us...I don't waste time with seduction and foreplay...I fucking want you. And my palm pulls up on your pelvic skin...stretching your clit to face me...then she feels my thumb swirl...
Her.
Fuck
Him.
Wet, intense swirls...and as I push downward and your lips part slightly...you feel the head of my cock begin to slide in, greased with our cum, and he stretches you out with the entire first slide...never stoppingbut you, my naughty little slut...I know you can handle it...
And so that's what you get. All of it. All of him. One firm hard figure8 against your budding pearl as my cock pushes to full insertion...my tongue sticks out and runs dangerously close to your ankle*
Her.
Jesus...
Him.
The strokes begin...and they echo my strokes from before...relentless, driven, primal. Fucking your tight, hungry cunt like you deserve to be fucked...your clit, completely manhandled...attended...coaxed*
My teeth...they join the party...and a bite of the skin on your foot...my lips inching closer...closer...feeling the hard bone under skin
Her.
My arm holding me up slips. I fall backward. Laid out across the tabletop. My head falling off the edge. I can't see you now. Only look at the city sprawled out. I can't anticipate your next move... just wait... Your dick slides hard in and out of me, shunting my body across the table so my breasts bounce hard. Your grip on my leg... Hard and tight. Spread out for you. Your cum on my nipples. your thumb pressing my clit as you inch closer to my boneFuck,I am going to cum... Can I... Please...Please
Him.
My teeth close down on the bone before you even get the sentence out...It's all happening at once as I lean forward...that first lean sends my cock driving deep into you, impaling you like a drilling rig, digging deep...filling that hot, sultry cunt
My hand falls flat against your left breast and I squeeze, your nipples between my knuckles feeling the tight twists and my thumb, working you...working you until you explode...I want that cummy shot
Kissing your ankle bone like I'm kissing an electrical socket. I can feel you seize and pulse underneath...and my cock and thumbs pounding and pushing you...all of you, my sexy toy to play with...and I grin as I watch the first glimpse of your orgasm pour from your lips...loving every second of it*
Her.
Pull out and I'll cum everywhere... I can't control
Him.
Another pounding thrust another...anothermy thumb swirls you forward and backward in tiny and large circles...
And I feel you building up, hear your screams get higher and pitch...and then pull my thickness from you. My head-turning and licking and biting your anklebone...my thumb continuing and your nipples tweaked then dropping to a kneel, one knee...and four fingers move to your clit to grind out your orgasm...my tongue right there to deliver the final strokes in the form of a deep loving kiss. kissing that soft, freshly fucked pussy as you start to sprayand that heavenly taste floods my mouth...and I move in for deeper kisses, holding you as close as I can no matter how you buck and writhe, forcing you to cum against my loving lips and tongue...
