One sunny, summer morning- I decided to get some sun. I played outside all day. A little work. Alot of sun. Some fun. Some oil. Some drinks, etc... Well, a whole lot of drinks. Hehe.
Throughout the day- I noticed that my grass wasn't growing below a window. Not just any window, but this was my bedroom window, (in the far back). I felt that it was kinda strange- until I saw the compacted dirt & a couple shoe prints. I immediately felt violated & I started to think to myself. I started to question myself.
***** What did they see? What did they hear? Am I being filmed? Am I being recorded? Is someone going to hold my playful, night-time activities- against me? Have I been discovered? Has someone been collecting evidence on me? What about my friends & my family? What will they think of me? What about my work & my reputation? What about my EMBARASSMENT?****
I couldn't dwell on the- "what if's"- so, my 1st instinct was to- saturate the ground- w/plenty of water. I sprayed more than my normal amount, so that I could completely "wet" the entire area, in hopes that the soil would be soft.
I partied in my room that night, as usual, with my window cracked, my music going, my porn vids playing & my blinds partially closed/opened. They're cracked opened-- just enough to see me, inside of my bedroom.
The next morning- I slowly snuck outside, before the sun came up & bam-- I had discovered footprints- fresh footprints. Yes, I thought to myself- I'm the man. Now what- I thought to myself, again? What was I going to do now? What's my next move? So I decided to go to a local "big-box" retailer & I bought a night vision camera. Later that day, I had decided that I would just place the camera- temporarily, next to my outside pots & plants. The camera was "wireless"- so thanks to the modern age of technology, or to the age of modern technology- my plan was going to work out- much easier than I had figured/assumed or planned upon.
I spent most of the day outside- again, while I thought about my attack (on just how), I was going to rearrange the furniture- inside of my room. I wanted to move everything accordingly & to situate my bed- so that it was directed, straight towards my window. I wanted my things to look comfortable & practical.
I made my changes gradually. Nicely & slowly- throughout the day. I would casually make an appearance outside- creating some kind of "noisy" activity. Usually- throwing a couple rocks into a wheel barrel- would do the trick. I wanted to create some attention, but not alot of it.
I focused on cleaning my room- with every "new" move, that I had made. When it came time to position my end table, (or night stand), I had a little problem deciding on how I was going to route the electrical cord- for my alarm clock. I needed to be practical & I really wasn't looking to create a "trip-hazard", for myself. Like I said earlier- I'm a drinker...
I continued working throughout the day, both inside/out, & surprisingly- I got some really good sun. I couldn't keep my hands off of myself, (typical), which never seemed to be a problem with me before. I've never felt as if I was being watched- so I have always- just played "freely", w/discretion, in my own backyard. Now, I felt as if- I needed to put on- some kinda performance.
I did my own personal attempt of "showing off". I would slowly pour water over my head & I'd let it drip down my body. I'd casually pinch my nipples & they would get nice and hard. I'd constantly rub my oiled body and I'd try to seductively- bend over to grab another rock, or to shovel another "scoop" of dirt, into my cart.
I'd go inside my house- to rearrange my bedroom a little further & to play w/myself. I would be sooooooo excited, that it was really difficult for me- to not just "explode", everytime that I touched myself. I was constantly thinking to myself- who's shoe prints????? Who's feet do they belong to??????
Darkness finally came. I was kinda nervous- but I was totally excited. My window was cracked. I was playing my music. I made myself a nice, "big" drink. I played my videos-w/o any sound, and I open my blinds- just a tiny bit. Just enough for someone to see me inside of my room----- stroking myself in the darkness. The only light visible-inside of my room- was coming from the porn video, that was playing.
I was trying to focus on keeping my regular- "playtime" hrs- but my boner was saying otherwise. I kept thinking about baseball & football. I was soooo excited- that I actually grabbed a cucumber from my fridge & I started to play w/it. I just couldn't wait to see who was spying on me. I was so curious. Who's footprints? Who's shoes? Who's feet? I live in an adult community- so I knew that whomever it was- that he/she would be- just as horny- as me.
While I was playing around w/my cucumber, (my toy for the night)- I kept thinking of:
*** How "bold", this person is.
*** How "bold", this person must be.
*** They're just as horny as me.
Voyeurism is a somewhat- natural instinct, (or so- I believe). Most people in general, or generally speaking,(my opinion), will always look @ something erotic- especially, if they know that they will not get caught- "while in the act of doing so"...
In this case however, when an individual is actually @ the forefront of a dwelling & perched "directly" outside of any visible opening---- residing in a top-notch, 5-star/master-planned community, he/she must want to see something spectacular. That's where I come into the picture. I've kinda always wanted to "play dumb", and to put on a show- for someome/anyone, priceless...
When I finally got a chance to see who the person was--- my toy couldn't get inside of my ass fast enough--- or--- deep enough, for that matter...
I was sooooo, totally "blown-away", when I finally got a chance to see who my voyeur was- that my toy got "sucked-up"!!... It literally shot-- straight up-- into my butt... I literally just- "froze"... O.M.G.- O.M.G.-O.M.G... My legs elongated & my feet tightened amongst themselves. My hands/arms just reaching outwardly- towards the sky. My screams silent- but my face showing my pain...
Needless to say- I've been getting alot more sun lately. I'm pulling my bathing suit down, (a little further), each day of sunning. I'm also raising my legs up higher & rolling-up my suit, just a little more- each time. I'm also getting into- spreading my legs wider... Spreading ones' legs- during an outside tanning session- is very, very erotic. It kinda changes a person... In itself- it's a "turn on".
***** Or, in/of itself- "it's a go".
******You know how it goes- when you are tanning. You just want to get that "ultimate tan". *******
***** You know. Right? ****
