A beam of moonlight pierced through the narrow window onto the cold earth as Selene's ethereal form lain sprawled towards the cold stone floor. Her eyes fixed on Bastien Leclerc: the brutish harsh, short-tempered guard strolling dank corridor outside her prison. Bastien was a walking mammoth of a man at over eight feet tall, bulging muscles rippling beneath his uniform with near-zero body fat. His thick neck and imposing stature were only further accentuated by the prominent scar that marred his forehead.
Selene watched him with calculated interest, her mind filling already with plans of seduction and manipulation. All that while remaining perfectly still every subscriptly of her body would shift slightly so the guard would get a glimpse of flawless skin or dangerous curves.
As Bastien passed by her cell, his eyes couldn't help but be drawn to the vision of beauty within. He tried to maintain his usual stern bearing but at the sight of Selene's beautiful figure, a flame in his loins long suppressed began to burst into an uncontrollable fire which he tried hard to put out. Abruptly, he tore his gaze away from Selene as the sound of heavy footsteps echoed in the corridor, signaling the arrival of another pair of guards. Bastien resumed his patrol with a face burning and flesh shrouded by tumultuous want.
Selene smiled to herself, on her pallet in the shadows of her cell, as she relished the power she held over the formidable man. She knew that already Bastien was ensnared in her web, but she needed to push him just a bit further--to ensure that he would be unable to resist whatever sensual allure she chose for the rest of them.
The next day, as Bastien completed his rounds, Selene decided it was time to escalate her efforts. She purposefully sat near the bars of her cell giving the guard a straight on view her magnificently full breasts as she wriggled and innocently stretched all while reaching above her head. She stared into the guard's eyes to wordlessly invite him closer which made Bastien's heart invade into rhythm gymnastics.
His breathing turned ragged as he tried to compose himself, hating how this prisoner could affect him so easily. And, yet despite his best efforts, the bulge itself had formed at the front of his trousers which indicated that this was not exactly true. He shifted uncomfortably trying to hide the erection in the folds of his uniform but it would be in vain; Selene had already seen it and now she was keen on taking advantage of him.
"Damn her," Bastien thought, clenching his fists in frustration.
Meanwhile, Selene was absolutely thrilled with herself because she knew how much sway she had over the huge man. She knew that with each passing moment, Bastien's desire for her only grew stronger. And as further her plan was unfurled, like a dark flower and came into its bloom, she could hardly wait for the coming day when she would be able to divert the voracious appetite of that mighty behemoth to her own interest.

Bastien's large hands clenched the iron bars of Selene's cell until his knuckles turned white while he fought a primitive urge to thunder into the dungeon and sweep her into his arms. His visits to her had become more and more frequent, each time with a new excuse to be near her, but always maintaining his severe attitude. He was like the moth drawn to the flame - unable to resist the pull of her body - body designed for seduction.
"Inspection," Bastien growled at last, making sure his voice carried with authority. "You stay in place."
Selene complied, but as she moved to stand against the far wall of her cell, she purposely allowed the thin fabric of her garment to slip off one shoulder, revealing first the soft curve of her collarbone and then, as the material behind her clung to her figure through static electricity, just a hint of her cleavage. She threw him an innocent look, her eyes widening and vulnerable, biting at her lower lip in a gesture that seemed equal parts nervousness and anticipation. It was a subtle flirtation that played on his ego, making him feel desired and important without ever speaking a word.
"Everything seems. in order," Bastien murmured, his eyes flicking away from the expanse of her exposed skin for a moment. But as he did, he found that he couldn't keep them from drifting back to it, tracing the lines of her body with an attention that made his member stiffen beneath its dark tunic.
"Good," Selene thought, her heart racing with excitement at the effect she was having on the brutish guard. "He's falling deeper into my web." Her eyes never left his form, and she could see the dread reckless battle that raged on the brink of erupting over of his sense of duty.
Selene's beauty appeared almost otherworldly in the dim light of dungeon, her pale skin softly glowing against the cold stone walls. Her full lips curled into a shy smile that seemed to welcome Bastien closer, to touch the silky smoothness of her skin and to lose himself onto the depths of her eyes.
"Damn this woman, I must resist her," Bastien thought, his body betraying him with each pounding heartbeat.
Yet he couldn't rip off his gaze with his mind filled with images of what it must feel like to hold her, to taste her, feel her body pressed against his. His breath hitched as she adjusted her garment that only let it cling even more tightly to these perfect curves, accented the way the breasts swelled above and the narrowness of the waist below.
"Pull yourself together, Leclerc," he inwardly scolded himself. But his conviction barely weakened by the second, crumbling away under Selene's silent seduction like a wall in the wake of a tremendous landslide.
The longer Bastien battled against the pull of her magnetic presence, even more Selene smirked in satisfaction of her mastery over him. With every look, with every subsiding change of her body, she was pulling him closer to the line knowing that soon he would fall -- and she could catch him.
---
The dim torch flickered against the rippling muscles of Bastien as he paced in front of the cell that Selene now called home, large hands clenched into fists at his sides. He didn't understand the magnetic force that kept bringing him back to her over and over again, not being able to get his mind off of absolutely anything else. His strong fingers brushed against the iron bars separating them, and he fought an urge to reach through them and touch her, feel her softness beneath his rough, calloused touch.
"Leclerc, you needed elsewhere," one of the other guards shouted to him, but Bastien could hear nothing with the pounding in his own heart.
"After," he growled back at him, eyes never leaving Selene for a moment.
"Whatever," the guard grumbled, stalking away and leaving Bastien alone with the object of his obsession.
Selene had positioned herself near the back of her cell, arms wrapped around her tight as if seeking comfort from some unseen chill. She kept her eyes lowered, long dark lashes stark against the pale skin of her cheeks. Her obvious vulnerability only made Bastien want to protect her that much more - though he would be hard-pressed to find anything else in life more powerful than her at that moment.
"Stand up straight," he barked, trying to maintain his harsh demeanor. "You're not a frail little girl."
Selene complied, raising her chin slowly until he could see into the dark pools of her eyes. The intensity of that gaze sent a shiver down his spine followed by surging heat through his veins as he noted his member beginning to harden.
"Hands to the bar," he commanded, desperate for something remotely controlled.
Obediently, Selene placed her delicate hands on top of the cold metal, gripping tight with white knuckles. Bastien could no longer resist without touching her, then he laid his arm between the bars to touch it at his fingertips: feeling the softness of skin and its warmth.
"Your arm feels warm. Are you feverish?" he said trying to cover his real intentions in a grumpy voice.
"No, sir," she almost whispered back to him.
"Please, let me check your waist," he said, even to himself straining his voice. His fingers slipped down her arm and around her waist, feeling the curve of her body under his touch. His fingers lingered just above her cleavage, the faint swell of her breasts dangerous close.
"Seems fine," he muttered, unwilling to remove his hand just yet.
Selene did not pull away but lay instead, allowing him to explore her body under the guise of innocent curiosity. She was fully aware that with every caress, with every lingering touch, she was weaving a spell around him, binding him to her will as surely as any magical incantation.
"Leclerc!" the sudden shout jolted Bastien from the reverie he'd fallen into abruptly pulling his hand away from Selene Marshal's body. Another guard stood a few feet away watching them with a mix of disapproval and suspicion.
"Right," he growled, turning from Selene's cell and striding away down the corridor, his heart pounding in his chest. However much he might hide his attraction beneath a gruff exterior, it was getting more damn difficult to ignore the lure she posed.
And Selene, standing silently in her cell just smiled at the power which she held over him, soon he would be completely under her will and she one step closer to revenge against the system that had locked her away.

The moon's light spilled in through the small barred window of Selene's cell, casting an ambient glow over the slim long frame of her form as she lay on the cot. She trailed her fingertips down her waist, knowing Bastien would not be able to resist the challenge of self-seduction and sexy allure she was almost throwing at him. He had been coming by more and more often, concocting excuses to loiter around her cell, and she had played her part with perfection -- magicking him into submission through looks and innocence.
Bastien paced up and down outside of her cell in the dimly lit corridor, casting long threatening shadows on the stone walls with his massive frame. His harsh demeanor quite concealed the overwhelming need he felt for Selene. The desire to possess her rose, and each time he saw her, it was clouding his judgment making it increasingly difficult to keep the gruff façade. The memory of his fingers grazing her cleavage haunted him, sendin' shivers down his spine and a hardening in what lay beneath his uniform.
"Damn her," he muttered under his breath as he cursed himself for stupidity that had entangled him within her web. But really, he could no longer help himself.
He gave a guttural growl as he reached for the keys on his belt to unlock her cell door so he can succumb to the lustful desire. Since Selene, entering, looked up at him pretending to be surprised but secretly glad from what he did. She knew that if he had crossed that line, she would have owned him entirely.
"Wh-what are you doing?" she whispered, her voice trembling and eyes wide with feigned fright locked onto Bastien's dark gaze.
"Shut up," he snarled, masking his desire with aggression as he approached her. "You know exactly what I want."
Selene shuddered, letting the facade of fear adorn her beauty even as she felt a thrilling excitement fill her veins. She let him take control, pinning her down on the cot with his powerful hands, his muscular body looming over her.
"Please," she whimpered, playing the role of the submissive to perfection. "Don't hurt me."
As he tore off her thin garment, exposing perfect breasts and shapely hips, Bastien growled, "I'll do what I want." His strong fingers gripped her thighs, parting them as he positioned to leave himself between her legs. He admired the sight of the flushed skin against the moonlit room and could not help but have a need to taste it.
As Bastien drove into her powerfully, Selene bit the back of her lip and contained her pleasure in obedience. She knew this would seal her control over him, that in giving herself to him she would irrevocably bind him to her will as much as she could have ever intended to do.
"Oh gods, you're so tight," Bastien groaned, driving into her with a primal need that both frightened and exhilarated him. He grunted with every thrust of his massive body against her slender form, while Selene reveled in the contrast, knowing fully which one of them was really in charge.
"Y-you're so big," she gasped, curving her back to meet his rough thrusts, playing the innocent victim even as she soaked in the long pleasure of his touch. She could feel the heat building and soon he would be hers for all-time.
The full moon cast its silver light into the cell, outlining ethereal beauty as Selene lay beneath Bastien. Her delicate fingers guided along his powerful arms, touch feather-light, guiding him to pin her wrists above her head. She barely managed to suppress a triumphant smile; she knew perfectly the way to play him and could see the way he was falling further under her power by the second.
"Stand still," Bastien ordered gruffly, voice muting any arousal that he might have been feeling. His massive body pressing against hers, the heat of his skin branding as he ground his hips into her. It was enough to have Selene offering him a breathless moan, letting the sound echo through the chamber like the sweetest of music.
"Please," she whispered, gazing up at him with wide, innocent eyes. "Be gentle."
"Quiet," Bastien snapped, yet his touch softened, lighting a flame that revealed he did fight some clandestine desire to please her despite his vileness. His lustful gaze roved the fullness of her breasts to the slenderness of her waist and finally to the still secret place between her thighs, seemingly to beckon him. He waited no longer than.
Selene felt his hardened length pressing against her, and she spurred him on by parting her legs further to grant him entry into her most intimate depths. Bastien impaled her with a guttural groan, and Selene focused on simply keeping the charade of submissive mate as sensations overwhelmed every other thought. It took her deeper than ever before, closer to ultimate release.
"Gods, Selene," Bastien gasped, moving faster and increasing his strokes with desperation. His immense muscles were prominent as he drove harder, beads of sweat falling from his forehead. The powerful form dominating her only served to bolster Selene's resolve for the true power in this encounter resided with her.
"Harder." The word fell from her lips, low and seductive as she secretly guided him that losing himself in the passion of their couplings would keep her alive. She arched her back, drawing his attention with the way they heaved with breath. Bastien's eyes grew hazy, his movements becoming bringing his response to her manipulations to a more desperate, needy level.
Selene could feel the thrumming energy within her, ready to be unleashed at just the right moment. Her interior monologue echoed her intention: soon, he would be at her complete mercy.
"More," she whispered huskily, the sound of her voice almost shaking with faked delicacy. "Please."
Bastien complied, unable to resist the plea in her voice despite his urge to keep up his harsh composure. He quickened his strokes, plunging deeper inside her, each thrust pushing him toward oblivion. Selene's body squeezed around him, her velveteen walls urging his release upon him.
As Bastien teetered on the brink, Selene's enslavement ability activated, channeling her dark powers straight to the core of her. She clenched tight abruptly around him, the sudden tightness pushing him over the edge as he exploded inside her.
"Selene!" he cried out in a mix of pleasure and confusion, his entire body shuddering with the force of his climax.
The magic passed through him enlightening his vessels with a pulsating pink tinge while at the same time filling his eyes with the same mesmerizing color. A blissful smile curved his lips as though he found his goddess.
Selene looked up at him with a triumphant smirk. Bastien Leclerc, the brutish guard once feared by her now answered to her call. He quickly proved that he was to be her slave for all of eternity and she reveled in the darkness this new power brought.
Bastien, still shuddering from the intensity of his release, gazed down at the beguiling sight of Selene below him. Her lush breasts rose and fell with soft breaths, and her glowing skin shone with a light sheen of sweat. She was a captivating and alluring goddess, and he had succumbed to the sway of temptation.
"Selene," Bastien murmured, his hoarse longing voice. His eyes, pulsing like a heartbeat at pink, stayed locked into hers completely enthralled. "You. you're incredible."
"Thank you, Bastien," she purred in a voice dripping with satisfaction. She traced a delicate finger along his bulging bicep, marveling at the power she now held over this massive man. "I could feel how much you wanted me."
"Anything for you, my goddess," his voice soft and devotion clear in every word. Selene found herself sheepish as she smiled, realizing how her scheme had fallen exactly into place. Bastien Leclerc who earlier in the day had been harsh and imposing was now putty in her hands.
"Get dressed, Bastien." She breathed the words, her voice a husky purr that was dangerously authoritative. As he obeyed, she studied him, enthralled with every move, every twitch and flex of his powerful muscles in his body. It was mesmerizing to have such a strong, proud man at her disposal, subjecting himself to her every whim.
Fully clothed, Selene rose with a sense of growing anticipation. Bastien now stayed as her devoted thrall, and it was at last time for her to begin planning how best to go about exacting the vengeance on those who had so heartlessly imprisoned her.
"Listen well, Bastien," she gently but smoothly commanded. "I need of your help. You will help me escape this dump, and revenge those that done me in."
"Of course, Selene," Bastien replied and his obedience was immediate without questioning. "What will you have me do?"
"First, we need to get information," she started, her mind already running overtime about the possibilities. "Find out schedules of the guards, layout of this prison, and maybe find any weaknesses in their security."
"Understood." Bastien replied and his massive chest swelled with determination. "Anything you ask of me, my goddess."
Selene's lips curled wickedly as she enjoyed victory. She had so masterfully twisted the brute, Bastien Leclerc, manipulating him from the brutal, oppressive enforcer to one of her thrall that were at her beck and call.
"Good," she purred, her voice dripping darkness and promise. "We shall bring this desolate system to its knees, once we have procured everything that we need."
