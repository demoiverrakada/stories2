In her anxiety leading up to the shoot, CarolAnn had suspected that it would be degrading to kneel on the floor and have random guys stick their cocks in her face. But the guys were for the most part very clean -- they had to be, it was stipulated in the paperwork they signed -- and polite.
Some guys didn't need the fluffers' help at all. Every guy here had clearly taken some kind of boner pill; some just jacked themselves off for a bit, and then approached the partition hiding the bukkake girl of the day, still pulling on their dicks.
Between cocks, CarolAnn watched these solitary guys. She had always found the idea of guys jerking off fascinating. When she is alone and horny -- which is a lot of the time -- she likes to watch the kind of porn where guys stand in a circle and jerk off together. Sometimes it's gay guys, but often it's just straight guys matter-of-factly pulling their big dicks together. CarolAnn loves the camaraderie of it, the way they kid each other, the way the guys compliment each other on the volume and distance of their cumshots.
Her best friend DeeDee, of course, is a trip. CarolAnn recognized right away that DeeDee's great talent -- besides her new tit job -- is her way of setting the guys at ease and making them feel less self-conscious. DeeDee has kept her promise of staying close to CarolAnn, so CarolAnn has had a front row seat to learn DeeDee's methods.
With the shy guys, DeeDee weaves a little romance, whispering in their ear, praising them for their cock size even if, especially if, they're on the small side. Sometimes she doesn't even have to suck cock at all. With one short guy, maybe five foot five at best, with a goofy goatee, she simply held his cock and talked to him in her hilariously filthy way.
"How many girls are thinking about this cock right now," she wondered. "Right this second? At least a few, I bet. You know, that's all we think about. Girls' minds are WAY dirtier than guys' minds. You have no idea. Isn't that right, CarolAnn?"
CarolAnn, who was beside her, her mouth bulging obscenely as a particularly well-muscled black man stroked his big curving dick in and out of her mouth, said "Mmmmpf."
DeeDee gently stroked her friend's manhood. "When we're all in the club bathroom, you think we're brushing our hair? We're not. We're talking about cocks. Big fucking brutal dicks like yours. We want them in our mouths. We want them in our assholes. We want all that slop you're carrying around in your heavy balls."
"Oh," goatee guy said.
"Do me a favor," DeeDee continued, "when you get up there, bust your tremendous load in that bitch's hair. Bitches love that. That's why we work so hard on our hair."
The guy groaned and actually sprinted to the front of the room holding his dick while DeeDee grinned mischievously at CarolAnn. Then she knelt beside her. "Give me a taste of that," she said.
Sometimes DeeDee arranged little games. She'd kneel beside CarolAnn and wait until they were both sucking cock. She'd stop sucking and look up at their new men friends. "You guys remember musical chairs?" she'd say.
"Uh huh," they would say in unison.
"Well, me and my slutty friend CarolAnn are gonna be the chairs. When I say Switch Bitches! I want you guys to change places. Okay?"
This was fine with them and it was fun for CarolAnn, too. If you were going to be used like a hole, you might as well have some fun with it. DeeDee even let CarolAnn take the lead once, and she shouted "Switch Bitches!" with great gusto.
The third time they tried this, CarolAnn's guy came in her mouth. It was hard to monitor who was close to cumming with all the bitch switching. Her guy groaned and started pumping a big slimy mess into her mouth. CarolAnn groaned too. She knew the guys didn't get paid if they blew their loads anywhere but on the bukkake girl up front.
But DeeDee saved the day. "Don't swallow," she said sharply to CarolAnn.
CarolAnn, who was still getting fucked in the face by this guy's wide and throbbing dick, just made wide eyes as her mouth filled up with slop.
"Don't swallow," DeeDee said again. When the guy pulled out, DeeDee held out her hand below CarolAnn's chin. "Spit," she said.
CarolAnn emptied the contents of her mouth into DeeDee's hand. There was a lot of cum. Some of these guys really saved it up.
"More," DeeDee said. "Spit."
CarolAnn spit again and DeeDee spit into her hand for good measure. She stood up, took the guy's hand while holding aloft her prize of gray goo with her other hand. "Come on with me," she said, "this is gonna be fine."
And it was. When DeeDee and her cum donor disappeared behind the screen, there was a moment of silence, and then a cheer went up. Then DeeDee returned, with a smirk on her face.
"Poured that shit right in her hair," she said. "Then I held my hand to her face until she licked my hand clean."
"Oh my God," CarolAnn said. "She did?"
"Of course she did. The video was rolling, you can't look like you're not totally gung-ho and game-on. That director chick loved it."
The other guy, his angry red dick and balls hanging below a slope of belly, was still standing there. DeeDee knelt again, looked up at his dick, and tongued a drop of pre-cum off the tip. "Honey," she said, "are you gonna splooge in our mouths?"
"No," he said.
"Good," DeeDee said, "because that trick only works once per shoot."
And so it went for more than an hour, CarolAnn and DeeDee sucking cocks and basically having fun. At one point, while the two were diligently working on two guys -- one a Hispanic guy wearing work boots like he'd just come from a construction site, the other a kind-of Middle Eastern guy wearing an obviously expensive wristwatch -- DeeDee stopped blowing her guy and said to CarolAnn, "Where'd you learn to suck cock like that?"
CarolAnn stopped sucking and held her guy's cock throbbing and twitching on her cheek. "Like what?"
"Like that," DeeDee said. "So neat. You suck cock like you're a nurse giving this guy an exam. You got to slobber on it little." She looked up at the Middle Eastern guy, who was now fucking CarolAnn's hand. "You like the girls fucked up a little, right? A sloppy mess?"
"Yes," the Middle Eastern guy said simply, as if this were self-evident.
And it was true that DeeDee had drool down her chin and on her boobs. She was also making a point of spitting on each cock, which CarolAnn was too embarrassed to do. She didn't think she had ever spit anywhere but in front of her bathroom mirror and probably at a dentist appointment, never mind on some random swinging cock.
"Watch," DeeDee said. She held her guy's twitching cock and inserted it into her mouth at an angle, so the head of it made her cheek bulge obscenely. Then she started fucking her face with it and making strangled wet sloppy sounds as more drool slipped from her mouth. And then, because she was DeeDee and she was fun, she crossed her eyes.
"That is how," the Middle Eastern guy said. "That is good."
CarolAnn laughed, and because the pressure was off and she no longer felt self-conscious, she hocked up a big loogie and hawked it onto the Middle Eastern guy's dick. Then she mouthed it again and tried to be sloppier. She even made some gross noises.
The Middle Eastern guy sighed and spread his legs a bit. "Better," he said.
At another point, as they were blowing two little Hispanic guys who appeared to be brothers, DeeDee suddenly shouted, "Eiffel Tower!"
No one knew what she was talking about, so DeeDee arranged herself and CarolAnn back to back, so the two guys were facing each other over the girls' heads. "While we're mouth-fucking you guys like filthy bitches in heat," DeeDee said to the guys, "I want you guys to wait until it feels really good and I want you to high-five each other."
So the two Hispanic brothers went back to enthusiastically plunging their cocks into the girls' mouths until CarolAnn heard a loud clap over her head. And then DeeDee yelled again, "Eiffel Tower!" CarolAnn looked over her head and then she got it. They were a triangle. A base formed by the girls kneeling and pumping away at cock, and the guys' two hands formed the point. An Eiffel Tower.
DeeDee knew a million crazy things like this. The two guys were still chuckling as the went off to add their baby batter to the mess up front.
At around that point, a woman's voice called out from behind the partition, shrill and angry. "I need a fuckin' break!" she said.
"Alright," another woman said. "Ten minutes."
DeeDee got off her knees and helped CarolAnn up. DeeDee had brought them towels to kneel on, early on, but her knees were still killing her.
"There's so many guys left," she said. There had to be sixty guys still loitering around.
"Yeah," DeeDee said. "Some of these guys won't pop at all. New guys. Nerves. The longer it goes, the harder it is for some of them. The producers always bring in more guys than they need. I heard they need a hundred cum loads."
CarolAnn was using her towel to blot sweat from between her boobs. Playfully, she reached out and blotted under DeeDee's boobs too.
"So what have we learned today?" DeeDee said.
"Well," CarolAnn said. She thought about it. "Some guys have weird dicks."
DeeDee laughed and CarolAnn was pleased. But it was true. There was an astonishing variety. Outlandishly curved dicks, and uncircumcised dicks with big droopy hoods. Long slender cocks and blunt, wide, short cocks. Enormous dicks on small guys and tiny dicks on big guys. No wonder guys obsessed about their cocks. Pussies were all basically the same, give or take.
CarolAnn found herself lost in the task of drying DeeDee's boobs. It was fun to feel the heft and the swing of them. It was amazing what surgery could do these days. She wondered if DeeDee had had work done on her nipples, too. Her areolas were so perfectly round and symmetrical, discreetly pale, not big and brown and bumpy like her own. And her nipples were so perky and jaunty, proud. When CarolAnn looked up from DeeDee's tits, she was still hefting and rolling them, lost in thought.
DeeDee was looking at CarolAnn with a specific green-eyed look, frankly amused and a little appraising.
"Let's take a break," DeeDee said. "You wanna go up front, see where the magic happens?"
CarolAnn reluctantly released DeeDee's boobs. "Sure," she said.
* * *
The magic turned out to be a brightly lit rectangle of empty space behind the partition and two women peering at what appeared to be video playback on a big camera, shoulder-mounted on a husky bored-looking guy. The women were both young and dressed in tailored business suits. One, CarolAnn realized, was the woman who had checked her lanyard pass.
"There it is again," one of the women said. "What is that shadow?" She turned, glanced at CarolAnn and DeeDee, then looked into the darkness behind them. "There are no fucking phones in here," she said.
Which was true. They had all been told to leave their phones in their cars. No photos, no random lights. There was no wifi down here anyway.
CarolAnn edged forward and looked at the playback screen over the burly guy's shoulder. A petite young girl, maybe twenty years old, was kneeling and holding her mouth open. Her hair was askew, her makeup a mess, one garish false eyelash on her cheek. Her face was covered with gray slop, gifts from the guys. A woman's hands, nicely manicured nails, fire-engine red, were on each side of her face. A big, half-hard, uncircumcised cock appeared above her face, being furiously stroked by its owner. The foreskin dangled obscenely, if anything could be said to be obscene down here.
She didn't remember this cock. When cum started to spew from it in lumps and spurts, most of it landed across the girl's nose and cheek. The two hands helpfully pushed the errant glop into the girl's mouth. CarolAnn realized that the girl was holding something. A bowl. CarolAnn turned around and saw the clear glass bowl on the stage, holding about an inch-deep of man milk.
"Let's finish this fucking thing," someone said.
CarolAnn, startled, turned and saw the girl in the video approaching from out of the darkness. She was still a mess, fake eyelash on her cheek. This must be what filmmakers meant by continuity, she thought. Indeed, an assistant, another young girl, also appeared out of the darkness with a cup and a spoon. The star came to a stop right next to CarolAnn and raised her face. The assistant spooned more gray glop onto her face. CarolAnn wondered if it was cum or a clever substitute.
"Hi," she said.
The bukkake girl looked at her, blinking in incomprehension.
"It's a, ummm, pleasure to meet you," CarolAnn said. "A, ummm, honor."
"Sylvester," the star barked. "Sylvester!"
Another person appeared. A guy in an outlandish tracksuit, like a rap star from the eighties. "You ready, sweetheart?" he said.
"Why is this person talking to me?"
Sylvester seemed to recognize the presence of CarolAnn and DeeDee for the first time, though they were standing right next to the star. "Oh my gosh," he said. "I'm sorry, Heather." He addressed CarolAnn directly. "Give Heather some space, okay? She's working."
DeeDee laughed and grabbed CarolAnn's elbow. She started to lead her away. "Hey no problem, Hollywood," she called over her shoulder. "You enjoy the rest of your meal."
Just as they were moving back around the partition, she heard the lanyard-checking girl call out, "DeeDee, you mind your fucking manners!"
CarolAnn couldn't help it; she spluttered out an unladylike laugh. "Oh my god!" she said, "I thought the guys just blew their loads on her face! She has to eat it all!"
DeeDee grabbed CarolAnn's elbow tighter and threw an arm around her shoulder. "That's what the ten grand is for. You should see the piss-drinking shoots."
CarolAnn dissolved into helpless giggles.
And then they were back to work.
They were able to help some guys, but CarolAnn felt sorry for some of the others. The pressure of having to cum just to get paid was too much, especially after being over-stimulated for at least an hour. She looked toward the back of the room and saw that Consuela, their long-forgotten third fluffer, was on her hands and knees, letting some guys go at it doggie in her pussy. Which was a mile too far, in CarolAnn's mind, but to each their own.
DeeDee was doing her level best. She cajoled; she flattered; she told filthy jokes; she fingered assholes and licked sweaty balls. CarolAnn tried too, making dirty gluck-gluck-gluck sounds as increasingly despairing guys fucked her face. But it was winding down.
There were about forty guys left when CarolAnn was surprised to see two police officers, in uniform, appear at the entrance door to the big underground space. Almost immediately, the lanyard-checking girl in the business suit came clipping around the partition on her mid-heels and met them at the door. The three of them started talking quietly. Lanyard girl turned and looked directly at CarolAnn and DeeDee, then shrugged her shoulders at the two officers.
Oh Jesus, CarolAnn thought. Am I breaking the law here? Am I going to be arrested somehow? She looked beseechingly at DeeDee, who was vigorously sucking one of the last promising cocks, belonging to a black guy as tall as a basketball player who had arrived late.
And once again, DeeDee saved the day. She had seen the officers, too.
"Hey, hey, hey," she said to CarolAnn. "Kneel here, face me." DeeDee had positioned herself between the black guy and the doorway. She held the hand of the black guy so he wouldn't wander away.
CarolAnn knelt and DeeDee moved forward so they were boobs to boobs.
"Ready?" DeeDee said.
Ready for what?
"Kiss me, you fucking beautiful bitch whore," DeeDee said. "Kiss me like you mean it."
CarolAnn went wide-eyed and leaned forward and was suddenly making out greedily with DeeDee. If she had to go to jail, at least she had this. Kissing DeeDee. Thirty seconds, a whole minute. She was in heaven.
DeeDee broke off the kiss but kept eye contact with CarolAnn, her big green eyes steady. "Okay big fella," she said, "slide that enormous white-woman fucking, baby-making cock between our lips. Fucking give it to us. We are absolute whores for black cock."
She pulled the black guy forward a step and started slobbering up and down one side of his cock. His was one of the bigger ones of the afternoon, probably eight or nine inches and really thick, with grossly bulging veins. Once she had established a rhythm, she said to CarolAnn, "Kiss me, you fucking bend-over whore."
CarolAnn applied her lips to the other side of the guy's cock and soon he was enthusiastically sliding his engorged manhood between two sets of lips. CarolAnn was eye-to-eye with DeeDee, falling in love as usual, while this black guy used their faces like a fucking hole in the wall.
Suddenly he withdrew and gave them both a pat on the head, like good puppy dogs. He disappeared around the partition and there was another cheer.
"Stay here," DeeDee said. She, too, patted CarolAnn on the top of her head. She was suddenly everyone's good dog, their bitch in heat.
DeeDee went over to the entrance door and the two cops. Lanyard lady had left. The way they were talking, DeeDee seemed to know one of them and was being introduced to the other.
As they were talking, one of the stragglers, a squat homely young guy with a single eyebrow and a hangdog aspect that practically screamed "incel," approached her and dangled his half-hard dick in her face. CarolAnn grinned up at this guy, another lost cause.
"Oh, my," she said. She reached up and fondled his balls. She tried to think of what DeeDee would say. "What hole should we put this in, I wonder?"
The guy looked confused. "Your pussy?"
"Ha," CarolAnn said. "Let's try this." She took him into her mouth. He was small enough that she could easily lap at his balls with her tongue. The guy spread his legs and waited for something, anything, to happen.
They did this for what seemed like a short eternity, with little progress, and then this last guy stumbled backward a step.
"Beat it, buster," someone said, and CarolAnn was shocked to discover that it was DeeDee. "Yeah," DeeDee said, "show's over, you missed it."
CarolAnn reached up and massaged her sore jaw as the guy pulled up his pants and beat a hasty retreat. She looked around. There were maybe a dozen guys left, some starting to pull on their pants, and the bright sparkly lights behind the partition had been doused. She had been sucking this guy off for nothing. She looked at the doorway. The cops were still there.
"Hey, listen," DeeDee said. "We got an interesting offer."
"Huh?" CarolAnn said. She was slowly getting up off her knees.
"You want to split another three grand?"
"Another..." CarolAnn stood up and massaged her lower back. She was beat. "What?"
"Three grand. Plus tips. Tonight."
CarolAnn tried to focus her thoughts. "Three grand?"
"For waitressing." DeeDee placed a fingertip under CarolAnn's chin and focused her steely green-eyed gaze on her. "Concentrate. These guys are gonna leave. They need a decision."
CarolAnn looked at the loitering cops again. "They're not going to arrest us?"
"No!" DeeDee said earnestly. "Don't be ridiculous. I know these guys. One of them, anyway. They're good guys. They have a monthly closed-doors get-together in a VFW hall near here. A basement bar. They need waitresses."
"Oh," CarolAnn said. "Like," she thought about it, "topless?"
"Like naked." DeeDee brought her focus even more closely to bear. CarolAnn felt like she was under a microscope. "Just bring them drinks, sit on some laps. That's all."
"Oh, I don't know," CarolAnn said. "Naked." She shook her head.
"Are you fucking me!" DeeDee exploded. "You're naked right now! You've been sucking cocks like a glory hole bitch all day! Are you crazy?"
CarolAnn's feelings were suddenly hurt. "I'm just... I've been working on this shoot. I'm a... what do you call it? A technical assistant."
DeeDee set a hand above her glorious tits, to steady herself. "Yes you are," she said in a measured voice. "This is just another... professional assignment."
CarolAnn looked at the cops again. "I don't know. A basement."
"THIS is a basement!" DeeDee retorted. "Did I say, three grand, plus tips?"
"Why can't you just do this on your own?"
DeeDee smiled. "We're a package deal. They want us both."
Oh. CarolAnn thought back to just a few minutes ago, when she and DeeDee had been slobbering over both sides of an enormous black cock for, apparently, a paying audience. "Oh," she said out loud.
"It's easy work."
CarolAnn sighed. "What do you mean, plus tips?"
Now it was DeeDee's turn to say, "Oh." She shrugged. "Well, things come up. If you're willing."
"I am not fucking guys for money," CarolAnn said vehemently. "Mouth stuff is one thing. I am not a cum hole. That one guy, that was an accident."
"Of course," DeeDee said.
"Technical," CarolAnn searched for the word, "assistanting. I am not a whore. I work in a fucking bank."
"Oh, honey," DeeDee said gently. "No whoring, I promise."
"Then what?"
"Waitressing. Naked. Sitting in a few laps. A couple of rounds on the stage."
"The stage?"
"There's a little stage. The guys, you know, they like a little..."
"A little what?"
"A show. Girl on girl stuff."
CarolAnn felt herself immediately going red in the face. "Girl on girl?"
DeeDee grinned an evil grin. She knew, CarolAnn could see, that she was sealing the deal.
"Just horny girls humping each other," she said. "Good clean fun."
"Oh." CarolAnn's resolve was melting away in an instant. "Me and you?"
"Me and you." DeeDee leaned forward and kissed CarolAnn gently on the lips and, at the same time, reached down and expertly caressed CarolAnn's clit, her precious little bean. "I wouldn't want to miss out on you."
CarolAnn's knees wobbled. She almost fell on the floor.
"Okay," she said breathlessly. "Yep, okay."
DeeDee laughed and flashed the two cops at the door a triumphant thumbs-up.

END. PART TWO.
