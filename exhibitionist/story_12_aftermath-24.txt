This is the third and final segment of Missy's Story and it isnota standalone story. It starts in Over the Top, followed by, Under Life, to finish in this, Aftermath. Aftermath is mostly narrative, told in three person point of view. Over the Top had no 'on screen sex'. Under Life had quite a long sex scene at the end. The middle portion of Aftermath contains quite a bit of 'on screen sex'. Not so with the beginning and the ending portions.
Over the Top covers Missy's remembrance of her and Janey's life growing up. Under Life occurs over a three day period. Aftermath covers over a thirteen year span, with the most of it in the epilogue. This is still a story of a three person romance. Aftermath is part of their life too, and as in real life it's not all sex (don't we wish) it's about life. Just a nontraditional one.
Please vote and comment, good or bad. They both mean something to the writer.

I was surprised to find that even before we had breakfast and finished dressing. Janey had appointments made for getting our tattoos done. I'd forgotten about her friend Kim. I knew Kim wasn't a close friend, just someone she's done art classes with before. But I remembered her talking about Kim and even talking about tattoos that Kim had done. Janey had been impressed, and with drawing it takes a bit to impress Janey. So I knew Kim had to be good. Janey was talking to Mark about all we had to do was to decided we were going to do it.
I said that I was doing it and if they didn't want to. Give me the address and some car keys, I was going. I agreed with Mark that the marks were fading and they could never be done again and mean the same thing. That lit a fire under them, but not the one I thought it would. I was told in no uncertain terms that Iwould notbe driving anywhere! It was too soon after being in the hospital, and I wasn't driving. Well, told that I couldn't drive started raising the hair on the back of my neck.
But after last night I still felt like the cat that licked up all the cream. I just couldn't raise up a good mad. 'I' was still grooming my paws. In fact I hadn't wanted to get out of bed. My lovers are both very goal oriented. I could have rolled around in bed all day, and been perfectly happy. Janey must have wanted to get a hold of Kim. I don't know what got Mark up. But I know he feels guilty about work. My two lovers, I'm still having a hard time believing that. Not Mark, but Janey, I fought against being a lesbian for so long. There's times it still hits me. But I truly don't think we're lesbians, we just love each other. And have for a long time.
Mark
*******
So after we had all woken up and got moving. Janey told us she'd already had our appointments made, for our tattoos. All we had to do was make sure that this was what we wanted. Missy was adamant, she was getting hers done. I knew that the marks had faded a lot, and if we took too many showers the pen marks would be gone too. So it was kind of a now or never thing. If they were to mean what they were, it wasn't something that could be redone at a more convenient time. It was now or never.
Janey got out pen and paper and drew out some ideas, for our rings.
Of course! Janey just happen to know of a tattoo artist who would be perfect. Of course this perfect tattoo artist just happens to be a woman. Not only did this perfect tattoo artist happen to be a woman, but the shop she worked at, happened to be owned by a woman. Not only did this perfect tattoo artist work in a shop owned by a woman,allthe tattoo artists who worked in this shop were women. Not only was this perfect tattoo artist, in this perfect tattoo artist shop, with all the other perfect tattoo artists who worked there, women. They were all designing perfect tattoos for all their perfect customers, who...you guessed it, were women.
Of course, I didn't find all this out until I was standing in the room, by the tiny little 'exam' chair. At first I was so concerned about the neighborhood and parking my car, and vandalism, that had all my attention. Being in the rough neighborhood, my second concern was the cleanliness of the shop. No worries though, it was spic and span to where it shined. Only when I was standing by that tiny strange looking chair, seeing all those women, did alarm bells start going off in my head. Plus Janey is whispering in my ear as fast as she can.
Janey swore up and down that she had no idea that this was a lesbian shop. She swore up and down that she didn't know if her 'friend' was a lesbian or not. She only knew Kim from some art classes they had taken together. Janey said that she'd always loved Kim's line drawings. She'd always thought that if she got a tattoo it would be from Kim. She'd told Kim that, and even made a promise that if she ever got tattooed she would have Kim do it. So the minute Missy started talking about our getting the tattoos. It had to be Kim.
Janey
******
I knew we were in trouble as soon as we started into the area where Kim's shop was. We were in Mark's very nice Jaguar, definitely not the type of car seen in this neighborhood. As soon as we got to the tattoo shop. I was trying to sink out of sight into the seat, The Sapphic Heart, with its Cupid's arrow through a very pink heart, and all I could see in the windows were women. I just about said something to Mark, but I looked at Missy. She had her hands over her mouth, trying very hard not to giggle. I could read it in her face, shsss, she seem to say. So I never said anything, and waited for the fireworks.
At first Mark seemed so worried about his car. As soon as he stepped into the shop, I thought 'any second now'. He seemed to be looking at the floors and counters. It wasn't until he met Kim in her booth that it hit him. That big Italian stud turned three shades of pale and looked ready to take flight. Missy was turning blue and choking trying hard to swallow her giggles. Kim had twigged on it right away, so she was just demurely watching Mark. In fact I think the whole shop stopped. Waiting for the explosion!
Mark's between 6foot 9 and 6foot 10, Kim is very close to Missy's size. Out of the ten or so women in the shop, I'm the tallest. Mark looked like Gulliver in a lingerie shop. He looked so little boy helpless; I couldn't leave him spinning in the breeze.
So I started whispering in his ear, apologizing that I didn't know what type of shop it was, I didn't know if my friend Kim was lesbian or not. But that I'd promised to have Kim do any tattoos I would have. But we didn't have to stay if he couldn't handle it. I said the last bit, about if he couldn't handle it; because I knew then he'd have too. It was starting to look as if we could have a lot of fun with Mark in this shop.
How could you not have fun? Mark, tall dark and handsome the epitome of being male, having to drop his pants in a lesbian tattoo shop! With Missy and I here as his lovers he couldn't run just because they were lesbians. With my challenge, 'if he couldn't handle it'. He was trapped! He knew it too, and it looked like someone poked him with a pin, and he deflated.
"Well I get to go last."
Melisa
*******
I was almost in a fit this was so funny. It could never have been planned out this way. I mean how perfect, my big tall Italian stud having to drop his trousers in a shop full of women, lesbian women. What Janey whispered to him seemed to stop his need for flight, and he settled into resignation.
"Well I get to go last."
Well in his place I'd want to go first, I'm kind of a rip the band-aid off fast girl. If you got to do it, get it over with. But I wanted to go first anyway, it started as my idea. So we had to sit down with Kim to explain what we wanted. I thought she got a little misty eyed when we explained everything to her. The marks, the rings, and what they meant to us. Kim asked how we had gotten together.
So I guess it was up to me to tell the story. So I did, I told her about me and Janey, how we'd met in the fourth grade, and were inseparable ever since. How that due to a traumatic event at a very young age, I'd a fear of being lesbian drove into my brain. I was not going to be a lesbian, so I denied Janey's love for many years. But we were still inseparable, until I fell in love with Mark. How in desperation Janey convinced me of our love, so now I had two loves. And they're coming to love each other.
Looking at Kim was a little spooky, her eyes jumped out at you first. I knew what it was called, Hetero Chroma Iridium. One of her eyes was a pale light blue; the other was a bright green. That combination and the rest of her was what was spooky to me. If you took some of Janey and some of me, put that together. You would get Kim; she's just as small as I am. Her hair is just like Janey's, long that same golden waterfall. Skin just as light and clear as mine. Her proportions are Janey's, that little bit smaller on top. Even her features would look like ours mixed.
I guess it settled a little of my heart, my fear of being lesbian. I could appreciate Kim ascetically, she was beautiful. With her combination of Janey's and my looks she would fit in our Group like a glove. It almost felt like a kind of fate.
Even as beautiful as she looked, with some of the best parts of us, there was no attraction. It was even more, every time she touched Mark the worst case of green eyed monster came out, I've ever had. I'm not a jealous person, not usually. But I was going to have to watch it when she did Mark's tattoo. Plus it was more too, Janey, I felt the same if she got too near to Janey too. I'd try hard to tame that green eyed monster, because I didn't like feeling like that.
Janey
*******
As we talked with Kim in designing the tattoos, Mark had one of those male 'whatever you women want' attitudes. And I guess I couldn't blame him, it was turning out to be an unpleasant experience for him. I really wish that we could change that.
Plus I was picking up some strange vibes from Missy. She was watching Kim a lot, with an intense look on her face. It took me a while to recognize it, because I'd never seen it before on Missy's face, jealousy. She didn't like Kim getting close to Mark. And as I watched her, she didn't like Kim around me too. I loved that, Missy loved us!
Then I had an idea, an idea for more fun. I knew Kim liked to stir up shit too, because we'd teased some of the guys in the art classes. So once I leaned into her as we talked about something in the drawing.
"Play along with me."
Then I when back to talking about color of the tattoos. Kim was telling us about this very special color. She'd found it at a national convention. It came from South America, from some of the tribes in the rain forest. I leaned into her ear and softly whispered.
"Play up to Mark."
I looked over to Missy, and Kim grinned, she'd seen the tension too. I took part of the drawing over to Mark and softly whispered into his ear.
"Play along with Kim."
Then I pushed the drawing over to Missy with a big grin at Mark, as Kim stroked his arm. He could see the tension settle into Missy's eyes, and he smiled.

*******
Kim was telling us about some special color that came from South American rain forests. About how a tattoo artist, who was an extra on the set of a movie, Medicine Man. That was shot in the rain forests with the tribes who lived there. The tribes had tattoos that stayed a brilliant color; most tattoos lose a lot of the color brilliance as they age.
This one didn't, the only thing bad about it was it only came in one color, almost a baby blue. She had some, and knew of two other shops that had more. If she could get the rest, it would be enough to do all of ours. Mark said we could do his in black if we couldn't get enough of that color, if that was what we wanted, that blue color.
My only concern was the fact it came from the rain forest, and we'd all heard of the exploitation of endangered species. Kim assured us that this was a common flower, not at all endangered, plus it was controlled in the amount that could be imported, as most things grown in the rain forests were. I liked the color; my vote was that we should get enough to do all three of us.
I was really having a hard time talking to her. She was touching Mark's shoulder, stroking his arm and he was smiling at her. When Janey and her were talking and working on the drawing, she would lay her hand on top of Janey's or pet her hair, touch her arm. And Janey was eating it up.
I had to stare down at the table, they weren't doing anything wrong, but I wanted to bitch slap her, scratch her eyes out. Pluck her bald, I had to control myself. I imagined I could feel steam coming out my ears, and then I realized that it was too quiet. I looked up at them, to see all three looking at me. Then Janey stuck her tongue out at me, then Kim did, Mark looked at them both and stuck his out at me too. They'd been playing with me. Janey leaned to me and kissed me. Mark came around picked me up into his lap and kissed me too. Kim leaned in like she was going to kiss me too. We all broke up laughing when Janey stuck her finger in Kim's face, shaking it no, no.
Janey
*******
It worked, It worked, I had fun teasing Missy. Kim had fun; most of all Mark's laughing and involved. He said his tattoo could be in black, but neither Missy nor I wanted that, the whole idea was to all be the same, the three all joined. So Kim went to call the other two shops and see if she could get the ink. Then she sent the shop gopher after it.
But we still had prep work to do. Kim needed to take tracings of our marks, to be accurate and to get a size for the basic design. We chose ring design and text font. Then Mark got nervous again, when we had to get the bite size, Kim wanted to look at the area to be inked. Sometimes Missy still amazes me, 'me first' then she drops her pants, pulls her panties down, and jumps into the chair.
First thing Kim said was that the pen ink we mark with had to come off; she didn't want to risk an infection. So she took the tracing, put locater marks on, and then scrubbed the area with a disinfectant soap. Both Missy and I are bare so nothing else had to be done. But Mark wasn't so lucky; first he wanted to use the tracings of Missy's and my marks as a pattern.
That didn't fly with either of us. They had to be 'the' marks, the ones we put there on him. He finally agreed, but he still didn't want to drop his pants. But he knew he had to, and Mark's no dummy. We'd all dressed with loose and easily removed clothes. So he was sneaky, he'd wore sweat pants, and pulled them down just as far as he absolutely had to, then tightened the draw string tight, 'so things wouldn't peek out'. The next problem was the chair, first he didn't think it would hold his weight. Kim pointed out that the frame was steel and had held bigger people. Missy laughed and said 'bigger than Mark', Kim made motions around her waist 'bigger'. Looked up to Mark's face, 'not bigger,' then looked down to his groin area, 'definitely not bigger'. I swear Mark turned three shades of red, and we heard a giggle from the edge of the curtain. Mark hurriedly sat in the chair. Kim kept giggling as she tried to get her tracing done. She finally went into the back, came back with foam and a razor. I thought Mark was going to climb the back of that chair. Kim just slapped some foam on and went to work, much to Mark's embarrassment.
Mark
*******
None of this is going as easy as I thought it would, in fact it's not going good at all! First it turns out to be a lesbian tattoo shop, of course a woman artist, whose just the cutest little bit. She's no bigger than Missy with Janey's hair. The chair looks strange with all these strange attachments. It's small and pink and doesn't look as if it will hold me up. There's just a light curtain around the chair, for privacy, but I guess they wouldn't need much, being all women.
Designing the tattoos wasn't a problem, in fact we had fun teasing Missy for a bit. Janey spotted that she was getting jealous of the attention Kim was paying to Janey and I. So she got Kim to play it up, and Janey and I made like we were enjoying it. It was funny, but I was amazed at howmuchit affected Missy; I thought she was mad enough to spit nails and start pulling hair out, of Kim. She laughed when we all stuck our tongues out at her, and everything settled out.
Of course either Missy or Janey had a problem getting the tracings done. In fact Missy jumped into that chair first, ready to go. I tried to wiggle out of it as much as I could, but they didn't let me get away with anything. First I wanted to use their tracings, that didn't fly at all.
Then I balked at the chair, it was too small, too frail. Kim pointed out that it was made of steel and that it had held bigger people, bigger around people. She looked up at my head and said 'not bigger'. Then she looked right at my crotch 'definitely not bigger,' and someone by the curtain started giggling. I bailed for the chair as fast as I could, looking for a towel to cover myself with. It turned out I was sitting on the nearest one.
She had trouble getting the tracing because of my pubic hair. She came out of the backroom with foam and a razor. Slapped foam on me and startedshavingme. It wasn't hard to keep from 'getting hard', not with a razor down there.
Melisa
*******
Kim was having trouble getting Mark's tracings. When she came back out of the backroom with foam and a razor. I thought Mark was going to climb out of that chair backwards, to get away from that little girl with a razor. She didn't give him time to do anything; she just slapped on some foam and started shaving. Mark looked like he was going to be tortured. But it was only about 15-20 seconds and she was done. Mark made a noise like someone punctured a wind bag. This was just getting started and we were going to have so much fun. Mark's hands fought with Kim's to wipe the foam off.
Kim told us to go to lunch because she had to do the final drawings and it would take awhile. Janey and I looked at each other shaking our heads.
"No Kim, if we let Mark out of here right now, he'll never come back. Go see what everyone wants and we'll order sandwich's in, for everyone."
"You sure Missy, there must be 12-15 people here in the shop?"
"It'll be easier than getting Mark back in here!"
Mark
*******
OK...I'll admit it. I'd bail out of here in a heartbeat and never darken this door again.
What if my college basketball coach or the Old Man saw me in the Sapphic Heart, with my pants at half mast, getting a tattoo? GOD... Or even worst my DAD, or ANY of the Group. I'd never hear the end of it!
I know Missy's my forever love, and yes I've been admitting it to myself today. I love Janey too, in my heart I know we've been talking about this triad relationship. Up until now I've had my doubts that Janey and I would ever come to a true love, as husband and wife. But I've been saying it to myself all day, today. I love Janey for herself, not just as part of Missy. I can't believe it's happened this fast. We've been around each other every minute for three days. Three very intense concentrated days, but it's just been three days!
For them, as much as I'd fight it, I'd be back to finish this, our rings. I've been thinking about this, about marriage. I can't see any way it could work out. There are laws in this country about bigamy, and I can't see us traveling to another country to get married. Just transporting everyone that would have to be there is a logistic nightmare. To say nothing of the cost, some people couldn't come. My folks for instance, they couldn't leave their restaurant for that long.
So I see us as doing these as wedding rings and saying vows to each other, making legal wills, maybe holding a huge party as a celebration, or reception.
So yes for them I'd be back!
Janey
*******
Missy's idea of getting sandwiches was genius. One look at Mark, and you could see he was ready to run. But he won't like hanging around here while Kim draws either. A least he'll be here, not running down the block and around the corner.
Seeing Kim shave him was more than hilarious. He looked like he was in terror, like he thought Kim might slice his dick off. He should have to shave a woman's tender lady bits clean. If you're not used to doing that it can get scary. A lot more loose skin and hidden places.
Maybe we should try and get Mark to go first? Maybe not, I want to have some fun with him. If we get him to go first, he can think of ways to get back at us. And I know what I want to do to have fun with him. Hey their back with lunch.
Melisa
*******
$300 dollars for lunch! Oh my god! That sure raises the price of tattoos. Oh...well at least when they're done its forever. And those two are definitely worth it. Plus we can't just let Mark pay for it all too, he always wants to. I know he makes a lot more money than Janey and me, but we should pay too. I know it's going to be a fight to keep him from paying for it all. The estimate of $850 dollars for all six tattoos, plus lunch, puts everything at over a thousand dollars.
Well we are taking up Kim's whole day. Making up six individual pieces of art work, and I've heard that they can make over a hundred dollars an hour. Maybe more, I wonder if Kim is giving Janey a deal?
Janey
*******
Oh...damn him. Missy came over and talked to me about not letting Mark pay for everything. When we went to the counter, thinking to prepay, he had already paid for both the tattoos and lunch. He gave a thousand dollars to Kim for the tattoos, and four hundred dollars to the girl who picked up lunch, a hundred dollar tip! But damn him we wanted to pay for part.
Then he brought tears to Missy's eyes, when he said that the man always paid for the wedding and engagement rings. Well maybe a tear or two to my eyes too. Then he went more and said that we should make up vows to each other. Then set up legal wills, and hold a big reception.
He said he'd been thinking about it, that there are laws against bigamy in most of the nation. Plus maybe some of our parents, friends, or business contacts might have problems with the three way marriage. That the rings and vows would just be to ourselves. We could even say the vows in a church if we wanted to, with some witness. With legal wills or contracts, it would be as binding as a marriage.
He said we needed to think about it, the vows were to ourselves. But the legal stuff we needed to think about and also to talk about.
I'm amazed down into my soul, I know we've all talked about this as a 'life time choice'. For god's sake, Missy's been mine for all my life. And I know it wasn't just sex last night, I know my heart, felt the fit of Mark. It wasn't just sex, but three days! We're talking about wedding rings and vows, and I'm not running. I'm totally amazed that I'm not running. I'll never leave Missy now that we've been together. But to put this triad relationship together, forever, in just three days, is insanity. My mind is telling me this, my heart is telling me. This is right.
Missy was ready to do it all, she was sure.
Mark
*******
Now I get to laugh, I could see them with their heads together. Knew they were talking about money and paying for part of this. But I beat them, it's already done. I watch them go up to the counter, and see on their faces. They know they've been beaten to the punch. I know love is always the foundation of any kind of marriage. But I've always said that my marriage was not going to be a 'yes dear' kind of relationship.
I believe that there are certain things that a man in a relationship must do, must provide. It's not a matter of a man being better than a woman; it's a matter of respect. Women whether they admit it to themselves or not, don't respect a man. If he doesn't do certain things, and I know that it's not the same things for each relationship. But they must each earn the respect of the other.
When I told them of my belief that a man should 'provide' the wedding rings. It set them back on their heels a bit. The idea that these would be our wedding rings. I know we talked about them being 'our rings to each other', but not necessarily wedding rings. Then when I talked about vows and legal papers
It brought tears up in Missy's eyes, and I think it really started to sink into Janey. The level of commitment we were doing and it was doing, not just talking about it. I could see the shock of it settle into her face. I was very happy to see, even though the weight of it settled into her, she's still committed to going forward. In watching her face and eyes, I think she might be starting to love me too, at least starting too.
Plus I told them that getting two wedding rings for a thousand bucks, I'm getting off cheap. Missy said that she wanted a regular set of rings too. I laughed, but I'll get them a set each too.
It looks like Kim is ready to go.
Melisa
*******
Well it looks like I'm up, Kim's ready to go. I don't have any doubts, I'm ready, and I want this. All of it and Mark's certainly given me plenty to think about while I'm sitting here. And strangely I'm not bashful about sitting here without my pants and panties on. I've always been a little modest, I'm no prude, but I'm no nudist either. But sitting here doesn't bother me. I think it's because I want this, I want the marks from my lovers made permanent. The fact that these are our wedding rings to each other too, only makes me want it more.
I agree with Mark about the other too. I don't think we could get a 'church' wedding, a justice of the peace, or even a Vegas wedding. In a way it might mean, even more if it's just us, the three of us vowing to each other. If we say our vows in a church, we would be saying them 'before god'. We don't need the priest, or pastor, congregation. All we need, all that matters is each other.
If we do wills, powers of attorney, maybe some type of a contract. It would have the same meaning in the future, for children and such, as a 'real' marriage. Yes I want this, all of this; Janey, Mark, tattoos, rings, marriage, and the future, with my forever loves.
I want the rings for my finger too. I want to show them to guys who hustle me in a bar, 'I'm taken, see I'm married'. I want my relatives to know and see I'm married; I want people at work to see. I want to shout it from the tallest building, I'M MARRIED to Janey and Mark.
OW, that tattoo gun doesn't really hurt, it's not comfortable, but it doesn't hurt. The color on my skin looks fantastic, such a brilliant blue, it's not an exact match to my eyes. But closer than most colors, that almost baby blue. Janey doesn't think it's as white as my eyes, but close.
Janey
*******
I can see that Missy and I are going to have to make a choice. A choice of our swim wear, it's going to have to be either larger covering bikini bottoms, or string thong type. Are we going to cover them up or hang them out? Probably both, but we can't go with a middle of the road style anymore. Mark won't have that problem.
Missy's right, the color is fantastic, her eyes are really like a husky dogs. This color of blue is so close it's scary; it just doesn't have the color variegation that her eyes do. Her eyes are so unique, its part of what makes her so special. With the outer darker ring, the mix of blue and white fading to white close to the pupil. No one else in the world could have eyes like Missy's. She's even had people think she's blind. I love her eyes, and I know Mark does too. But Kim's eyes are pretty fucking amazing too, one blue, one green. People have always said my eyes are amazing and I know they say the same about Mark's. Right now in this booth, we're the ordinary.
Missy says getting the tattoo doesn't really hurt, just sort of. But I'm scared of needles.
Mark
*******
I thought Janey wouldn't have a problem with undressing to get the tattoos. I thought Missy might, but she didn't. Drops her pants and underwear jumps up in the chair, no problem. I guess this being the 'Sapphic Heart' is for the girls, like the locker room at the Y is for the Group, no big deal. Not for me, this is going to suck.
They're right the color is amazing, and it's close to Missy's eyes too. I guess I'll go with the blue too, but it sure is bright, I hope it stays like that.
Oh...ha. That's sweet, Janey's afraid of the gun, not that it hurts. She's scared of the needle. What did Missy call her that time, an armor plated slut, well the armor is looking a little weak right now. She was right about Kim though, her art work is good. I'm glad; I'm going to be wearing it for the rest of my life.
Melisa
*******
Oh...Janey, my Janey. Is scared of needles, I'd forgot that. She hated to go to the doctors or the dentist. Her Dad had to drag her, and she couldn't watch the nurse. When we were really little, she cried so hard, crocodile tears. She couldn't even watch me get a shot. This is a trip, she's almost sweating and she's so tense, white knuckles.
It's so funny, and Mark's really hooting it up. He better not laugh too much, I know she was already going to mess with him. Now I'll bet she will be pure evil. Janey's an exhibitionist, a tease, a prankster, and she just loves messing with people. She's certainly messed with me enough throughout our lives, roped me into enough trouble. I know she'll get me involved in this too.
Mark
*******
OH...God this is going to suck. It's my turn. Missy did everything so easy, dropped her pants. In the chair, barely an ouch, talking to us all the time. Just like she didn't have a care in the world. Kim said she was perfect, didn't even wiggle once. Cleaning the area with the solution, bandaging it up, she didn't even twitch.
Janey was a hoot; she was in such a panic. I teased the shit out of her. But she really didn't do too badly. I've seen some big guys pass out because they're afraid of needles, and that's funny. But now it's my turn.
I turned my back on Kim, push my unit straight down my legs, dropped my sweats to the base of my dick and sucked the draw string up tight. Then sat on the towel covering the chair, they were giggling at me already, all three of them. I better relax, I know they're going to mess with me, and if I let it bother me it will just get worse. This is going to suck!
At the start it wasn't too bad, I mean they laughed, and teased me. Big boy scared of all the little girls seeing him naked, things like that. Missy got behind me, tickling my ears, kissing my neck. Then she tried to pinch my nipples, and I couldn't get away and not move in the chair.
Then Janey started slowly dancing behind Kim, she was playing with her nipples, rubbing them with her fingers. She'd stick her hands under her shirt and lift her breasts, wiggling them at me. Lift them in her hands and rub her nips with her thumbs.
I didn't think that they'd do this type of teasing! And pulling that draw string up tightwas nota good idea. The least little bit and I'd start making a tent in my sweats. I tried hard; baseball scores, fat ladies in bikinis, account books. Janey came and bent right over Kim's head, unbuttoned her blouse. Started squeezing her breasts together, lifting her cleavage to me. I tried hard, to keep it from...
Missy's kissing my ears playing in my hair, rubbing my chest. I heard all the giggles coming from the shop girls and I knew they're peeking around the curtain. I don't know if they're watching me or Janey, maybe both. I would close my eyes and get it to go down; I thought I had it under control. Then I felt it, just barely, Kim was lightly moving her forearm back and forth on me, on my dick. And I started tenting up and they laughed.
Missy was so jealous before, I can't understand why she's not now. But she's laughing and smiling now. I go back to fat ladies in bikinis, really fat ladies. It's starting to work, and then Janey unzips her pants and slowly slides her hand down the front. From the shop;
"He doesn't have a chance, the bets up to ten bucks now, any takers?"
I wouldn't take that bet!

That was so much fun screwing with Mark. But now it's no fun, we have to wait four to six hours before we can shower. Then it can't be very warm water, if it's too hot it can leech some of the color out. Several things we have to watch and several we can't do. Mostly it's a bit sore; I don't think any of us are going to be up for some serious sex. That's a shame because we're all kind of horny. This is all so new, and strong, the three of us together.
It's after ten tonight before we can shower, but it's special when we do. The slick of our bodies sliding together is Sooo...sensual. I love sliding around, against and between their bodies. Putting Janey in the center, using my body to press her up tight to Mark. Feeling his hands on my body, in my hair, suck on his fingers.
Press against his front and pull two handfuls of his tight ass to me, his hard cock on my belly. Feeling Janey's hips against my hands on his ass. Her breasts tight on his back, one hand in my hair, the other stroking his chest. The tattoos look so hot with water running down them, even if it's cool water.
Kissing soft lips, kissing full strong lips, sucking tiny, tiny hard nipples. Sucking soft breasts with hard nips. Feeling soft lips pulling on my tight hot nipples, large heavy hands cupping swollen breasts, with heavy hard cock against my butt and back.
Moving around each other, Janey and Mark deeply kissing, I slide my hand on Mark's shaft; slip my fingers into my Janey. Rewarded with groans from both, I want to push them tighter together. But I know I can't, I don't want to hurt them where their tats are, so I just play with my fingers. Not to get them to cum, just feel my love.
I get to play with Janey's hair for a bit, just to get it dry. When we get into bed, Janey bumps into Mark's tats. He jumps back and hit's mine, next thing; we're all rolling around each other. Laughing, playing like little children. It feels good, light on our hearts, just to get stupid silly.
It doesn't last long, of course. Grabbing boobs, pulling on dick, rolling around in a pile of puppies. Some ouches too, but not getting in the way of our fun. Finally Mark pins Janey down, and I get to her tattoo. I really get to looking at it real close, and it's so beautiful. The drawing is so good, fine strong lines, vines and little flowers and buds. The rings with our names on the inner face of the band. I'm so glad Kim suggested this color, it makes these tattoos special.
The brilliant light blue on our skin is so much more than I've seen in most tattoos. Most tattoos look a little faded even when they're new. I think that's because they're under the skin, like a sheet of light,almostclear paper over them. Ours look as if they're painted on, on top of the skin with bright paint.
Janey and Mark are kissing, as I'm tracing Janey's tattoo. So I slide down lower, onto my Janey's soft, bare mound. Her full pussy lips, find her little button. And just very lightly play with it, with just the tip of my finger. Not touching anything else just the tip of her clit, with the tip of my finger, very softly, very slowly.
She starts to squirm, unable to stay still. I get my other hand in and just trace her opening, barely touching. Down to just touch her anus and she jumps. I go back to touching her opening, just barely inside, with the tip of my finger. Then coming out to circle the opening again, all this time stroking the tip of her clit.
Looking right into Janey's sex, playing with my fingers. How strange my mind is, fingering her is okay. Oral sex is a lesbian act, and my mind still balks a little. I know I 'cleaned' her of Mark's cum last night. Again my mind is making that distinction, between oral sex and cleaning. It's not that I don't want to, or that I might find the act unpleasant. It's just that it's the final line to cross, and I have to cross it, want to cross it. I want to have sex with my Janey, fully.

Missy's driving me nuts! Mark and I were wrestling and he pinned me down. Kissing and pinching my nips, just playing. Then I felt it, just the barest feather touch on my belly where the tattoos were, Missy's finger tracing the shape. I could feel her lying on my leg, and she must be looking straight into my sex. In very little time, feather touches my clit, so very softly. And I feel it throughout my whole body, the shiver touch. It's driving me nuts, it's almost too light to feel. And not heavy enough to, satisfy my body.
Now she's just touching my opening the same way, just hard enough to feel but no more. Oh...just barely inside, her finger went just barely in me. It's all so soft, but it's driving me nuts! I want more...harder, please! Ah, finger slid into me deep. Then I feelIT,Missy's tongue! My body just jumps, bunches up and jumps. As she drags her tongue up my slit. Down, to move side to side on my clit and it starts to burn. Deep in my core it starts to burn.
She keeps lapping me with her tongue, touching my clit, and lap up me. Mark's sucking, biting my nipple, brushing my hair with his fingers. None of their touches are very hard, just soft feather touches, gentle nips. But all of this is driving the fire in me, hotter, higher. My mind is floating; all these feathers are turning my nerves into electric wires that are plugged into my mind.
Missy sucks hard on my clit, pulling it into her mouth. Let's go and sucks it into her mouth again, again! As she pulls hard on it once more, I CUM, and my mind exploded!
All those electric nerves fired, and my body spasms! Then they fired again, my muscles knotted, hard! They fired again, and held...held, and didn't let go! I kept cumming, cumming, and they stopped...and my muscles still wanted to fire, wanted to keep cumming. But couldn't quite, couldn't quite fire all the way. And my body kept twitching, jumping.

I did it, I did it, and I made my Janey cum with my mouth. I crossed that last line...
But I don't feel any different. I don't feel ashamed or like a lesbian. I don't know what a lesbian is supposed to feel like, but I don't feel any different. It's like crossing that last line showed me that there was nothing to fear. I'm still me, still the same person as I was.
Watching her body jump and jerk in aftershocks, all I feel is proud. Proud I made my Janey cum, and she came good, too!
Mark and I slide up to hold her as she settles down. Kissing her, each other, touching. Hair, bodies, just playing, feeling...soft easy love. Janey rolls over top of Mark, and pulls me up to lay on top of him, 69. I shake my head, no. I don't like to have Mark do this. My torso is so short, with so much height difference between us. It makes him bend his neck up so hard to reach me, I love him to go down on me, and I love to suck his cock. He just can't comfortably reach this way.
Janey just smiles, pushes me, rocking my hips back so Mark can reach me and sucks his cock into her mouth. Bobbing on that big cock for a few seconds, she pulls me up to where I can suck him too. A little bit, she pushes me back again, and I get the idea. Back and forth we go, back to feeling Mark's fantastic tongue, watching Janey suck him deep. Up to pull his cock into my mouth, tasting both Janey and Mark. Janey licking his balls or the base of his cock. Laughing as Janey and I play fight for his cock. Groaning as I push back onto his tongue. Back and forth, back and forth, sucking.
Playing, laughing. I'm surprised when a hard fast orgasm, slams through me. Fast hard and done, back to playing and laughing. Another one surprises me, quick fast, and done. I groan with my head back as they pass through me. Back playing, laughing, and pushing Janey off for my turn. Flash as another one hits, bigger, harder, still fast and done.
As I go back to playing I can feel Mark's stomach muscles clenching, in time with the bobs of Janey's head. I can feel my core twitching, still trying to knot up. My turn on Mark's cock, I slide as much as I can into my mouth, and push, trying for more! Then I feel my core start to clamp as Mark's big finger shoves into me! And I start winding up to orgasm, fast!
I start to jerk my head up and scream, as I feel Mark swell and pulse in my mouth! One pulse, two...but my head's already moving up, and I scream. One pulse straight up in the air and Janey's diving down for the rest, sucking, swallowing. My butt sits down on Mark's chest, as head down my orgasm settles.
Looking up to Janey she starts laughing. I know why, as I can feel it run down my chin. She comes up licking cum off my mouth and chin. Kissing me she pushes it back into my mouth, kissing I snowball it back to her, and she to me. This time I swallow it down; say against Janey's lips, 'my share'.
We slide back to lie on Mark's shoulders, Janey on one, me on the other side.
I'm barely asleep, watching that little spot of light, that little firefly dancing on my eye lids.
I become aware of little grunts and twitches from Mark. Opening my eyes, I see Janey bobbing, sucking on Mark's cock. They are not doing it hard, maybe to keep from waking me up. But it looks like Janey's trying to see how far she can go down. She gets to a place, you can see her throat work and she pushes down. But she gags and comes right back up. Down to try again, it's fun to lay here and watch her. She's so determined to go farther. She just keeps trying and trying. Bobbing up and down, then tries to go deeper, gags, lifts and go back to bobbing, and tries all over again.
But I don't think Mark's complaining as his hips follow up each time she pulls off. Janey's eyes look up into mine, as she starts bobbing faster, not going deep, faster. She keeps staring into my eyes; Mark grunts, pushes, tightens and starts filling Janey's mouth! She rises to where she has just the tip of the head in her mouth. Letting the cum fill in her mouth.
As Mark settles, Janey knee walks over to me. Pushing me to my back, she moves in between my thighs, pushing my knees up, spread. Up on her knees she brings her mouth over my pussy, and opens, letting the cum from her mouth fall, running down onto my clit. Down, she sucks it back into her mouth, pulling my clit up with it. Up, she lets it run out of her mouth and fall onto me, again, and again.
Swallowing, she settles onto the bed and proceeds to eat me, lovingly. Mark rolls to us, softly touching my breasts, watches. Even though I been asleep, it doesn't take Janey very long and she's winding me up. I can feel my feet shivering, clenching my toes, starting to cramp. My belly is quivering, muscles twitching, small clamp, loose, small clamp. Then I feel it; hard clamp, grunt, clench, grunt, jerk and I'm cumming, cumming. I can feel my toes cramped up, my feet rolling inward! My legs are tight around Janey's head, jerking! My eyes are twitching, rolling back; head back, mouth open but no sound!
Just a long deep sigh as it releases, and the aftershocks jerk through my body. The shocks don't even settle before they wrap me in their arms and the warmth settles into me. Soft words of love and caring float back and forth. As I slide back into sleep chasing my little firefly.

It was only a couple of weeks before the guys saw them, my tattoos. I really tried to keep turned away in the locker room. I don't know why, they were going to see them sooner or later. I guess I knew that I'd catch a ration of shit when they saw them. And I did, they laughed, called me pussy whipped. Said one ball and chain wasn't enough for me, I had to go get two.
I said two words, love and sex. And they didn't say anything more.
But I noticed something happening in the Group dynamics. They looked at me with a kind of awe. I had to do something about that. I needed the Group, I needed the Group to be whole, needed them for our company. And the dynamic had changed and I had to get it back. I needed to do things as Mark, Janey and Missy. With, and in the Group, the guys loved them. Took them under their wings, and loved them. Now the Group had three sisters. Five guys, one sister, two lovers that are my wives, that was my family.
We've been together for about two months before I have to make my first trip, a run to our plants in England. It won't take long, maybe a couple of days at the most. But it's the first time the three of us have been split up.
"Mark can we have a talk for a little while?"
"Sure Missy, what's up?"
"Well you'll be gone and it's the first time we'll be apart. I think we need to talk a few things out."
"I know and I bet I can tell you what it is you want to talk about."
"Yeah...but we should still talk about it, right Janey?"
"I agree, the only way we can keep mistakes from being a problem, is to make sure everyone is on the same page."
"OK, girls...I'll say this. Don't do anything that I wouldn't do."
"That doesn't leave much out, does it Janey?"
"No, it's kind of like a blank check, right Missy?"
"What I want to get straight between us all is what are we to do if one partner isn't there. I don't want someone to feel cheated on or left out. What would we do if say one of us had to be gone for a month or more? Or someone gets sick and is in the hospital for an extended period of time. Or just, is here but for some reason can't make love, a day or a month or more. What do we do? And I want it said out loud, so we all know what was said. That's what I wanted to talk about Mark."
"OK, girls. Here's what I think we should do. Let's call it the honor system. I think we're all of like minds and just want the others to be loved. If it doesn't feel right to BOTH the remaining partners, it's not right, and it shouldn't happen. Think of it like the boyfriend test, if you wouldn't do it in front of the other, it's wrong. The other thing would or could be is to talk to the absent partner. But I don't think that's necessary, I just put it out there to talk about. With the honor system it doesn't matter if its one day, a month, or six months. If it doesn't feel right to both the remaining partners, it's wrong. Then we could talk about it later, on a phone call or when we were all together again. Sound good?"
"It does sound good Mark, but what about this? What should you and Janey do if say I got pregnant? In late term pregnancy I might not be able to have sex, but I'm here. Do you guys quit?"
"That's a good question. What do you think Janey?"
"Well usually the husband follows the wife, if she can't; it doesn't mean he can go somewhere else. But that's in a monogamous situation. With us, unless both of us are in late term pregnancy's, there will always be someone available. But it's a good question because some people view it as a show of support for the wife who can't. I would be willing to do that, show support by abstaining."
"So would I, girls."
"Well Mark, Janey here's a good test for your honor system. Because I wouldn't want you to abstain. Why have two give up the opportunity to show love because one other can't? I would feel bad to do that to two people I love. If I couldn't make love, I could at least be close to you and share in the love, that's what I would want. Even if I couldn't be close, I would still want to know that the love was being shared. But that's just an example, because we would be right there to talk it out. But you see the possible problems?"
"Yeah Missy, but I still think the honor system covers almost everything. With the checks and balance of having both of the remaining partners agree. It would include most problems. But girls there is really only one problem. If one partner is using sex with another partner, to hurt the third partner, with the second who goes along. We have more, bigger problems than just sex.'US'together only works if it's us, all three, of us together. If it becomes two on one, it's broken! And it's a bigger problem than just sex."
"Missy, I agree with Mark. I think the honor system will be the best. I agree, it has to be the three together, if it becomes two on one, we better fix it right away, or it is broken!"
"I agree with Mark too. I was just playing the devil's advocate, because I felt it was better to agree aloud. Than someone questioning things, we could have worked out before hand. So yes I agree that the honor system is what we should do."
It's got my vote."
"Mine too."

So honor system it was, it was probably not necessary for three adults to go through all that. But it made fewer chances for mistakes. When you deal with Groups of people, it's amazing how easily they can screw it up. And sometimes it's the smartest people that will do it. In some way you could never imagine.
The first night Mark was gone Janey and I both had to work late. A bunch of things had to be gathered into presentations. Maybe for Mark's trip, I don't know. One of the things we agreed to right away was work stayed at work and each other's work stayed separate. We didn't need to be talking shop at home. So maybe Janey was getting information together for Mark too, I didn't ask. But we just went to sleep holding each other, and that was good too.
Second night we went out to dinner and had a regular girl's night, not dancing and such, just Janey and I by ourselves. It was fun, going out to dinner, sometimes we were tweaking with other people. Couples that were around us, wondering if we were together or just friends and we left them still wondering.
We were telling our waitress about my husband Mark, then about Janey's husband Mark. Mine was big and Italian, Janey's had dark hair and blue eyes that went with his being Italian. A little later she talked to the waitress about how big he was. I think she finally clued in. She asked us; my husband was big and Italian, Janey's was big and Italian. Janey said that would be telling tales now wouldn't it. I think she was still wondering, but she thought she knew, and it was fun.
Getting ready for bed we both showered, yes together, and it was soft and sensual. We got clean and it didn't take long. While Janey finished up. I got my stuff ready to do Janey's hair. She smiled when she seen all the stuff spread out on the bed. Then she pulled a hair brush out from behind her back, flashed a huge grin at me.
We sat on the bed and Janey directed me to the way she wanted. We tried to sit Indian style but it wasn't close enough. So I laid my thighs on top of Janey's and we were almost touching breast to breast. I would dry Janey's hair for awhile, then she would do mine. Back and forth, until we were close to dry, then the hair dryer passed back and forth.
Somewhere in there Janey started touching me, as I worked on her hair. I would do the same when she was doing mine. So it was breast and nipple play, small kisses. Continuing to work on each other's hair, soft touches on belly and mound. Back and forth, it went slowly raising the heat in each other.
I started feeling it low in my belly, a small ball, a knot, that swelled and got heavy. Janey's fingers slid into me, high enough to touch that special spot. And the ball burst, slowly deflated. It was, I think the softest orgasm I've ever had; it wasn't fast, just slow and soft.
That was the way that Janey and I were moving and touching. Soft and slow, in no hurry. After my orgasm I gave the brush to Janey, and went back to playing with her body. I did the same to her, fingers in as high as I could reach. Touching that small rough spot, slowly rubbing it. Watching my Janey's face, as she tightens on my fingers. I was watching when she tipped over into orgasm. A soft sigh, and she gave me the brush back. We started all over again, and again, passing the brush back and forth. About two hours of this and our hair was dry and shone, Janey's like gold.
She pushed me onto my back, and slid her mouth onto me. Started raising the fire in my belly, lips, tongue, soft nips. She played me, played with that fire, and I just let her. Laid there and let her built that fire. Build it into a campfire, larger, into a raging bonfire. I burst, screaming for Janey, screaming my joy and love for her. Then I pushed her back and made my Janey scream for me.

I think that I've changed, I love having them here. It's hard to believe that in six months I could change how I look at things. I think one of the ways I've changed is that my pace in love making has slowed to match theirs. When they make love together, the two of them. It's slower, softer, languid, and so beautiful. I still can tell when one of them is in the mood and just pound her into the mattress.
They're both so beautiful that sometimes I'll round a corner in the house, see one of them. Stand there amazed at the beauty in front of me. Half a year and they can still do that to me, stop me. I have to stand there in awe, staring.
In bed is where I notice the changes in myself. I love to watch them together. Watch them make love to each other. It's then that their beauty shines, shines out through their eyes. On their faces, oh...god I love to watch their face when they cum. Sometimes I have an orgasm too, just not with my dick, with my heart.
And I think it will burst!

After eight months we decided that it was time. We were solid enough, to tell our parents about us, everything about us. We started with my parents; we thought that they might be the easiest. I had already told them a little about Mark. So we invited them up for dinner at Mark's house, which had become our home.
Mark and I met them at the front door, and they were very impressed with Mark's house. My Dad loved the timbers and beams, the leather and wood furniture. Mom loved the floors and the colors.
When Janey walked out of the kitchen telling us that dinner was ready. Mom just smiled, gave Dad one of those married looks. The one that said 'I told you so', and all he did was nod. Mom went and gave Janey a big hug and a kiss on the cheek.
"We love you too Janey, you're like a daughter to us. And we knew that where ever Missy ended up in life, that's where you would be to. Plus we knew it would be as lovers too. You guys were only fooling yourselves."
Janey and I took Mom to the bathroom and showed her our rings, and then we went to dinner. Janey's cooking impressed Dad as usual. Then she told him about Mark's entrees, he was impressed with that.
"Robert, congratulations are in order, they have rings, But you don't get to see them!" and stuck her tongue out at him.
"Mister Williams, I'll wear a tiny bikini some day and show you." And stuck her tongue out at Mom.
That night Janey came up with one of my favorite positions for making love, all together. After playing and rolling around in our pile of puppies. Kissing, sucking and raising the heat in all of us. She pushed Mark onto his back. Helping me onto his cock, up, down. Until I was fully seated on him, stuffed as fucking full as always. She slid around and behind me, like we did our first night.
Her and Mark playing with my breasts, Janey's hand down thumbing my clit. Feeling Mark's cock slide in and out of me with her fingers, building the heat in all of us. She pushed me up, rocking on my knees. Off Mark's cock, until I could lie on his chest and kiss him. Then she pushed her fingers back into me, thumbing my clit, fingers hooked up in me. She slid her legs wider, lowered, up and down, up and down. Worked herself down onto Mark's big cock. Riding cock, playing in my pussy she went for a while. Lifted up and I sat back and slid back down on Mark's cock, her hand back on my clit. Both playing with my tits. Back and forth we went, me riding, Janey riding.
As we went back and forth the fire took a long time to built, and we rode, and loved it. Then I wanted to switch, it was hard for me. When I got in place and it was my turn. My legs went so wide, to get down onto Mark, I couldn't move. So I just held up a little and Mark stroked up into me. When it was Janey's turn to ride I got to play with her. Her clit and feel Mark's cock fucking up into her, feel the slick on my fingers. And I loved that, feeling them sliding together.
It was hard for me, tired my legs out. So we switched back, and kept riding, me then Janey. We just couldn't go on forever, although I wanted to. We could tell when Mark started getting close, and we went faster. Janey rubbed my clit faster. We fanned the flames higher and faster. I was close, real close when I felt Mark powering up into me, driving. Felt him swell, felt his cock swell, and drive one last time into me. Tight, hard, when I felt his seed burst into me. I popped, and came. He was filling me and I was flooding him, and Janey's fingers.
And I screamed!
Janey
*******
I felt them, felt Mark slam up into Missy's tiny body. Felt his cock swell, felt it pulse. Fire up into her, felt her body jerk and shake. Felt it flood heavy cream into my hand. Felt him pulse again and again, filling her. Then felt them drop, drop all that tension. Felt their bodies deflate, and soften.
I moved around to Mark, pushing Missy back. I sat on his chest, pulling his cock into my mouth, sucking Missy's and his cum off of him. She slid up to help me, help me suck Mark's cock. We didn't let him go soft, kept sucking him. He kept sucking and tonguing me, fingers and tongue, keeping up the fire in my belly. Kissing Missy and sucking Mark, I kept working the heat back into them.
When Mark was rock hard again, I turned and went back to the position of riding him, with Missy on my back. We started all over again, riding Mark, Missy riding Mark. Back and forth, I think with all the position changes, it slows the rush to orgasm down, teases, building up, and then switch and it stops the building. Then you start all over again, start building, teasing. Then switch and start building again, building it higher. Teasing, building it higher until you just can't stop from cumming.
Mark started driving into me hard, lifting me clear off the bed, Missy too. She sped up on my clit, to follow his speed, and drove the fire in my core. Hotter and hotter, pushing me to keep up with Mark. Bursting I screamed, cumming, screaming. I was starting down, when I felt Mark swell and fill me with heat, pulse and fill more. It flashed through me again, and I was cumming again, and again!

I'd met Mark's folks a couple of times, when he'd taken me out to eat at their restaurant. We brought them in for dinner at the house too. I love his Dad; he's such a larger than life Italian chef. If you looked at a dictionary for Italian chef, if there was such a thing, there would be his picture. He is so old world too, manners, respect for women, it's just part of him.
His Mom is just the other side of the coin from his Dad. She would be there, with a bambino on her hip, a ladle in her hand, a pan of sauce, on the stove. Directing all the other kids around and telling them what to do.
I didn't think his Mom was going to be any trouble but I wasn't sure about his Dad. He is old world, and I don't think there are many triad marriages in his family. In his mind it might not fit in the round hole, us the square pegs.
I was right, his Mom just saw more grandchildren. I saw right away, that his Dad wasn't sure if he liked what was going on with his son, not sure at all. But I hadn't factored Janey into the picture. Before he could get too puffed up, she offered him her hand, 'to come help her in the kitchen'.
His Mom slid up to me and wanted to talk babies, how many, if I wanted babies, if Janey wanted babies, I might have told a little white lie there. Baby names, how many boys, girls, church to raise them in. It was all babies, and Mark was laughing at me.
What he didn't know was, I was happy, I wanted babies. I'd been around women who just wanted to talk about babies. Around a Group of women who want to talk babies, soon it was about labor, about birth. About female problems, and the men folk had already run off as fast as they could.
Janey had won over Mark's Dad, she loved to cook. She loved to cook fancy dishes, and she'd cooked tonight's meal. Plus she'd made special dishes, things he didn't know how to make. That led to talk of pots and pans, spices, heats. Lead to where the dishes came from. After the meal was done, Janey asked Mark's Dad if he liked the meal, the luke warm response was, it was pretty good. The Star Trek, Mr. Spock eye brow came up. 'It was just pretty good?' he laughed and admitted it was more than very good. And everything was right in the world.

I've known since we first seen Janey in that sports bar in Brentwood. She can be a cocky bitch. Handling my Dad tonight, she's crowing. Missy's laughing at her, and my evil mind is working overtime. When we got ready to crawl into bed, I grabbed her tight with her back to me. Pulled her up on the bed. Loudly:
"Missy fuck her up, make her come!"
Missy's staring at me, scared at what's going on. When I give her the big wink that Janey can't see, she knows I'm playing with Janey. She acts real scared, and starts playing on Janey with her fingers. Janey's struggling, until I wrap my legs around her, and tie her down tight.
"Faster, harder make her cum!"
I reach down and give Janey three sharp, but not hard, slaps right on her pussy. And that bows her back with a quick cry. Missy still doesn't know if this is quite right. So I reach down and stuff two fingers into Janey and rapidly start fucking her with them. Pull out and give her a bunch of real fast slaps. Then jam my fingers back in her, fucking her fast as I can. Add a third finger, and keep going.
She's stretched pretty tight now with three fingers. I keep making sure that I'm touching her clit on each stroke. I can hear the wet of her, feel it on my fingers. Hear it squish as my fingers are slapping into her. Pull out and slap...slap...slap on her pussy. She can't move because I'm wrapped around her tight. Slapping her pussy draws a deep, deep groan from her.
I keep trying to get Missy's attention to get her in place for the next part of my plan. But she's just staring at Janey, withering in my grip. I wish I had something I could throw at her, but I need to keep my attention on Janey. So I'll do it myself.
I move off Janey quick, grab Missy and throw her up on the bed. Grab Janey, flip her over and push her head in between Missy's legs. Grab her hips lifting her ass in the air, push on her again. Shoving her face into Missy.
"Suck her cunt bitch!"
In one, two, three pushes I'm buried balls deep in Janey. And she's wet, real wet. It's running down her thighs, I hear the squelch of it as I fuck into her. I keep pressure on her back, keeping her face pushed into Missy. I pound into her, reach up and grab both her arms and use them to pull her back onto my cock, I put them both into one hand and slap hard on her ass.
"You sucking that cunt bitch?"
I push on her back and shove her face into Missy again, and spank her again.
"You sucking bitch? Suck hard. Fuck her up, suck her off, and make her cum!"
I punctuate each three words with a slap to her ass, pull her arms back and start pounding into her again. She's so fucking wet, I'm sure Missy can hear it squelch as I'm slamming into her. I can tell Janey's not doing anything to Missy. So I cuss at her, flip her onto her back, and just drop down on her. Line up and drive into her in one push.
"AH...FUCK!"
I start pounding into her, not to hurt her. I just want her to feel like she's being drove into the mattress. With my body lying on her, she can't move. She's helpless and I want her to know that. And she must like it, as I feel her start to knot up. Her pussy shivers, her tits shove into me as her back arches. Her eyes roll, she clamps down on my cock and HOWLS, cums, and howls again.
I move fast, pull out of her, and grab her hips flipping her over. Pull her back and slide into her, all the way in. Grab her hands and pull them back. Using them again to control her, pull her back to me. Driving into her hard, I hear grunts of air each time I bottom out in her. 'No...no...no more', her muscles jerk, pussy clamps and she howls again, cumming!
I've never had it happen before, but I can't imagine anything better. Janey's body takes about three strokes then she clamps on me again and CUMS, stroke, stroke clamp and she's cumming again. Three strokes clamp and howls cumming again, Again and again, and I can't take any more, drive in and bury myself, let go and fill her. I don't think I even made a sound, it all poured out my cock, into Janey. And she HOWLED again. And dropped, her body just went limp, her legs went wonky, and she falls face first onto the bed, inert.
I looked over toward Missy to see tears running down her cheeks!

I see Mark looking at me. I can feel the tears running down my face. The look of terror in his eyes. Part of my mind can see this, and that part wants me to go to Mark.
The other part is blank, numb. I've never seen anything like that; my mind is having trouble processing it. Nothing fits in my computation. Nothing fits; I've seen something out of my universe. My mind just doesn't...
But my body and heart knows what my mind doesn't and I'm crawling into Marks lap. I wrap him in my arms, my tears onto his chest.
"Mark I don't know what that was, it didn't fit in my universe. It was sooo...different from anything I've known. I'm not handling it well. What was it?"
"Missy, remember when you told me Janey was a 'Bad Boy Girl'? Bad boy's don't make love to their 'bitches', they fuck um. I think somewhere inside Janey she needs to be fucked hard, bad boy style. Not all the time, even 'bitches' like to be made love too. But have this need to be dominated sometimes. When Janey was crowing so hard about my Dad, it was over the top, too much. It was like she wanted someone to push back."
"Exactly Mark, and thank you for the best bad boy fuck, I've ever had. I know you've never seen this Missy, growing up I never had either.
You know how sex with young boys is never very good? Until they've learned a bit, it's just not earth shattering. Well one of my early boyfriends, was a bad boy. But he was a bad boy who knew what he was doing, and he rocked my world like never before. And I loved it; I think that if I hadn't been in love with you, I would have found a bad boy to love. Or like Mark here, someone who knows what I need sometimes."
"I couldn't do that, Mark please never do that to me!"
"Missy, Mark would NEVER treat you like that. He would never see that you needed it. He knows how much it would scare you. It's just not in you, not in your make up, not part of who you are. And I would NEVER let him do that to you.
Missy to you it would feel like rape, to me it's an amazing fuck."
"Please both of you; don't let me see that again! My emotions are so messed up right now. I've heard of BSDM, and stuff like that; my mind knows that stuff is out there. Watching this tonight, it was the man I love raping the woman I love, and I can't get over that. Please I love you both, and I don't want you deprived of anything you might need. But please let me know and I'll go elsewhere.
Tonight when I started to fall asleep, my firefly wasn't circling, dancing. She was hunting, flying fast, hunting. For what I don't know.

We only had the last set of parents left to talk too. And we've waited a year to do that. We all know it's going to be trouble. Janey's Mom, it's going to get ugly. We decided to have the talk at their house. I've never seen her Mom before, and I can't remember why Missy and I ran into Janey having lunch with her Dad, one time.
Her Mom doesn't look like the ogre that I envisioned. She looks pretty normal, average height, somewhat slim like Janey. But she has nowhere near Janey's beauty, she looks average. I mean that you can see a little of Janey in her, but it just doesn't add up to be special like Janey. Plus her face is just sour, the expression, sour.
It wasn't the big blow up that we thought it would be. Janey's Dad came up and gave us all hugs and congratulation. We didn't notice it right away. But her Mom just disappeared; she left and never came back. Her Dad felt like he had to apologize, we said he didn't. She was the one who left, and maybe it was for the best. We knew she was going to be trouble.
"I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life, and I come here to tell her about it. She just disappears, well as far as I'm concerned she just disappeared from my life, forever."
"I don't know what happened to her all those years ago, Baby. But she changed. Now days I don't know why I've stayed with her. We're so far apart. In the early years after she changed I stayed for you, Janey. Now I think it's just momentum and laziness. This hurts me too, that she'd just walk away from her daughter."

It had to hurt; I know Janey and her Mother don't get along. I know that Janey doesn't like the person her Mother has become, so judgmental, so rigid. But for god's sake it's her Mother, it has to hurt. For her Mother to just walk out on Janey's happiness!
Tonight, Mark and I decided was for Janey. It was all to be for her, to show her our love. And we did, I loved my Janey with my mouth, my tongue, my fingers, mostly with my heart and soul.
We started in the shower, Mark and I hurried through our cleaning. Then put Janey in the middle, and we made love to her with soap, hands, bodies. Our fingers too, Mark held Janey's back against his chest. Played with her breasts when my tongue wasn't there first. Mark pressed against her back, me against her front. As breast to breast, as I can. Kissing, sucking her nipples, licking her breasts, all with my hand and fingers in her. Stoking the fire in her core.
Under the rainfall head, it felt like a warm rain on a summer's night. On my fingers, I could feel when she came. My Janey screamed for me when she came. Her legs gave out on her and Mark had to hold her up. I went back to kissing her and making love to her breasts, as Mark took over with his fingers. Her fire was already hot and his big fingers stoked it higher and higher, until she came again. Mark held her under the water fall.
I went and got my hair stuff all ready for her. Mark held her on his lap, with her legs wrapped around him, arms around his neck, cock inside her. Just sat there holding her, while I did her hair. I didn't do it as long as I usually do, because she couldn't just sit there. I got it to where it was dry and I was brushing it. She couldn't stand it anymore and had to move. As she rode in Marks lap, I held her, kissed her neck and ears, her skin, cupped her breasts, and pulled her nipples. I slid my hand down in between their bodies onto her clit, until she came apart for us, screaming again.
We lay my Janey down on her back, I slid her legs apart. Made love to her, with my mouth, tongue, fingers. I made gentle love, soft, slow, gentle love. I didn't want my Janey to cum quick; I wanted to make love to her until she was done. She came for me, a soft slow climax, and long sigh.
And I settled in to please her. After a bit I started stoking the fire, faster, some with my teeth and fingers. Found that rough spot up in the top of her, rubbed it until she started knotting up. Then sucked her clit into my mouth and nipped with my teeth. Wonder of wonders my Janey filled my mouth, she squirted, screaming, she squirted again.
We pulled her up to the center of the bed, and held her. Wrapped in our arms, it broke loose and my Janey cried, She cried, sobbing she let all the pain fall out onto our love for her.

We'd been together about eighteen months when I got a huge eye opener. Janey came to Missy one weekend. Said we had to go shoe shopping, I said for them to go ahead. Missy looked at Janey for a little bit and started laughing. She told me I just had to go, that it would be lots of fun. A guy out shoe shopping, fun?
So we went to a mall at west gate, it was a big mall. But just an average mall, not expensive, just average. Wandering around Janey selected a shoe store, but said she needed the restroom first, and Missy giggled. I couldn't see why she giggled, but OK. Janey came back and handed me a small bit of fabric. A PANTIES and BRA, and headed into the shoe store. She had a young kid picked out. Pointed out about three pairs of shoes and sat down on the fitting chairs.
She had the whole thing planned out, a loose fitting top. With a wide swinging waist, full loose skirt, she hadn't needed the bra. She just wanted to shock me, and she did. When she had met the guys at the sports bar, I'd said she was a master, little did I know.
She played this kid until he sang like a cello. It was always just...almost...enough to see, but not quite. The girl had tricks, lean over to look at the shoes. The hand came up just in time to cover the sag in the neck line; the kid knew she didn't have a bra on. Just by the way everything moved, she'd lifted the side of the skirt up once, enough so that he knew she didn't have panties on either. She played him with the shirt, almost got a peek. Then he'd realized that he might have had a look up the skirt, but missed it. Bend at the waist and just before he got a look up her shirt, the hand came up between her breasts and the shirt didn't fall enough.
We left the store without any shoes, the kid had a big stupid smile, and I thought maybe a spot on the front of his slacks. Janey went looking for another shoe store.
I was the one who spotted him first; a wife was reading an old guy the riot act. I don't know what he did, or even if he did anything. When I pointed it out to Missy and Janey she was going to town on him. Told him to sit on this bench and not move, started stacking her packages by him, and left.
Janey smiled at Missy who giggled. Janey parked us where we could see. When down and asked the old man if she could sit with him, her feet were sore. He was a nice older gentleman; he stood up to invite her to be seated. Left her plenty of room, and when she started talking to him he was polite and attentive.
She started her tricks, and he ate it up. They had quite a dance going on, and they both loved it. Laughing, talking, jokes just like two old friends. All the time it was this dance of Janey's that almost was a show...almost. And he laughed, and they both danced. To have this extraordinarily beautiful woman teasing him, with this...almost display of her beauty. He knew that he was in a special moment in time.
Janey stood up, turned and squatted down in front of him. I couldn't see, but Missy gasped. I wondered if the skirt was high enough. She told him that his wife shouldn't be as much of a bitch to him. As she stood, she leaned forward and kissed him in the center of his forehead. Her hair fell so no one could see anything from the side. But she made no effort to cover for her blouse's neck line. She kissed his forehead for a good long time.
I hope when I'm as old as he is, my heart will be in as good a shape as his. He could have died right there with a smile on his face, if it hadn't been. We went looking for another shoe store.
The one she found had a completely different type of salesman. Slick suit, slicked back hair, slick polished look, I would have called him a lounge lizard. One who thought he was god's gift to women. And Janey played him, used all her tricks and touches on his arm. When she asked for a pair of shoes from the backroom he had to take a box lid with him, to cover up the front of his pants. He thought he had it made, when she stood to leave. Without any shoes, he gave her his card, to call him. As we started to leave I noticed the card was sitting in the middle of the chair she'd been sitting in.
Almost...but not quite. Actually was never going to be even close, not even possible, but he didn't know that. Janey just wanted to dance.

I'd been out with Janey teasing before, in fact quite a bit. See she never went out teasing without back up. So unless she had a boyfriend that would help her, it was me, and my Janey's an exhibitionist. The thing that was different this time was, before she had gone home after, or to a boyfriend.
I never knew how cranked up it made her, Oh my god. Good thing it was Mark and I both at home. I didn't think she would be satisfied until Mark and I both had fifty orgasms, and a hundred for herself. She was a wild woman, or definitely Mark's wild child. I wasn't thinking about it at the time, but I don't think she missed any way you can combine sex for three people. I know some of them would have been more fun if you hadn't needed a road map. Fifty, I know I didn't make it, but she tried.
I know that I was sitting on her face, just as I started to cum when she stuck her finger up my butt. I don't know if I liked it or not, I was already cumming. I know that I flooded her face, the sheet, and the bed. I know she loved that. I know that when I was riding Mark's cock reverse, and she was licking both me and him.
I flooded his cock, her face both. Plus the sheet and the bed, he flooded me at the same time. I don't know if I liked her finger in my butt, but I know that I'll never have anal sex. With Mark's huge cock, and my tiny, tiny butt hole, NO never going to happen. If Mark wants anal sex he better talk to Janey, there are some real advantages to this triad thing.
Tonight my firefly was quiet. As she appeared she went right to Janey's belly and landed. Stayed there for a little while, and then crawled up between her breasts to her heart. I faded into deep sleep while she was there.

We went out with Mark's Group a lot. And we really had some great times. The company Christmas Party was one of the best! The ones where we had them over for dinner were special too. I love to cook, the guys in the Group loved to eat. There's nothing more a good cook likes than an appreciative eater. And for those dinners I had six plus Alex, Missy and me. It was a blast cooking for them. Part of the kick was thinking about what my coworkers, would think of me with the Group. All the big shots and Missy and me, cool.
I know they worried about me for the Christmas Party, but I'm not stupid. I know which lines not to cross. Yes I love to hang my toes over those lines. But this is Mark's company and I will do nothing to bring any disrespect to Mark or Missy. That doesn't mean that I can't have fun too.
Both Missy and I bowed to Mark's wishes and got evening gowns, expensive evening gowns. He must have talked to someone, because he sent us to a dress shop that you had to know where it was at. If you didn't know where it was at, you didn't need to be there. If you needed a label on the dress you didn't need to be there, if you needed a price tag, you didn't need to be there. They had an especially trained sales person for each customer, because you needed an appointment to get in the door.
This place scared the shit out of me; this middle class working girl did not belong in here. But Missy talked me into it and convinced me to enjoy it while I was there. So I did, I listened to Missy and the sales girl, excuse me, fashion consultant. They knew everything, the right type of color for me, the right general shape for my body type.
Once we went over a lot of pictures of dress types, and the ones that were for my body type. Only then could we start looking at dresses, they brought out more fashion consultants out with makeup. Then had us try on different dresses, trial dresses. If the dress was very different from the others, then new makeup. For Missy and I it took six fashion consultants all day to find the right dress. Part of that were the pictures they wanted. They had a form for us to sign, and they called in a photographer. Wanted pictures of almost all the dresses we tried on.
Alex was more than a little pissed when she heard about the pictures, but they had got us to sign a form, so that was the end of that. Alex said that there would be words spoken into certain ears. Things mattered more than just lawyers.
But I have to admit they knew what they were doing, dressed in my dress ready to go to the Party. Looking in the mirror, I didn't believe that it was me. I almost couldn't stop looking at myself, until Missy stepped in behind me.And I fell in love all over again!She was so beautiful that there are not enough words to describe her, as she stood there.
A diamond tiara, a jeweled scepter, and crystal shoes, and the biggest kingdom in the world. Could not make her more beautiful or important. She was a fairy Queen, A Royal Court Princess, and the most beautiful woman in the world, all at the same time.And she loved me.And my heart broke, because I could never be as good for her as she was for me!
Mark came into the bedroom and just stopped...and stood there...looking at us...

I never looked at the bill from their dresses, didn't care. One of the secretary's said that there was a lot of zero's on it. When I stepped into our bedroom, with them standing there together, all dressed and ready to go. It was worth every penny, times ten. It was and will always be one of the special moments of my life.
Because I fell in love with both of them all over again!
They both loved me! In my life I will never understand that...just be eternally grateful.
I'd thought that my love for them was the pinnacle of possibilities.It just doubled.If Helen of Troy's beauty launched a thousand ships. What I see standing in front of me would launch a hundred thousand. I stared...with my mouth open...feet locked in place. I was blank, I couldn't think, the guy that always had to do the job. Always had to stay focused on the big picture, couldn't decide if I needed to breathe again. So I don't think I did...breathe...again.
But mundane thoughts always intrude and I'm glad that I called for a limousine, they deserve nothing less. I just wish it was a Silver Shadow Rolls Royce, they deserve nothing less. But they will get everything I've got.
When we get to the Ballroom, I felt a lot of pride. Entering into the main area it's like Moses parting the Red Sea, the crowd parts as we approach, leaving us a clear path. The three of us draw the attention of everyone, I don't know if I like that. But I also can't do anything about that. I've always tried to maintain a low profile in the company. After this, I don't think I'll be able too, entering the biggest company function, with two of the most beautiful women on my arm. Is definitely not a low profile, after this everyone will know they're both with me, both of them.
As we go by, I think that I might be able to keep my low profile after all. I don't think anyone is even seeing me; the mouths are open staring at these two extremely beautiful women. As they should be, looking around. There isn't anyone even close, even Alex is staring with her mouth open. I wonder which secretary was commenting on the bill for these dresses, and I wonder what she thinks now.
What I see down the way makes me very happy, the Old Man is here, and Mary too. I feel like a little kid who wants to run over and show his trophy's to his Dad.

For a girl who loves beautiful fashions. I was in heaven in that dress shop. We spend a whole day, looking at dresses. With six highly trained consultants, to help us, with color choices, make up choices, general body type dresses, trial dresses. When she told us we had to wait a week to get our final dresses, I knew that they would be very expensive. Because, waiting a week, and with the fitting and measurements we had to do. They were going to be custom made dresses, custom designed just for us.
Janey was a dream, she never once complained, or hesitated. She jumped right into the spirit of the day, and the slut never made an appearance. She paid attention to the consultants, and asked my opinion a lot. She couldn't have been better.
Standing in front of that mirror in our bedroom,she came into her own. Janey's always been a true beauty. There has always been something not quite complete about her beauty. I've never understood what's been missing, but it's not now, it's here and she'scomplete. This vision standing here is Janey at her absolute best. She is here complete, done as the best woman she can be. There can be no doubt she as arrived as the full grown finite woman.
Her beauty in that dress does something to her, Janey. She stands different, her body carriage is unmovable, and she is so solid in her own beauty, so solid in her own femininity, in herself. She shines, she glows and she's standing tall, proud, powerful, and her absolute beauty is only a small part of it. If that dress wasn't so beautiful in its own right, and look so completely a part of Janey. You would almost not notice it, it is a custom made for her dress. Designed for her, and you can almost ignore it, the change in Janey herself is so profound.
Right now, at this moment in time, she is the most beautiful woman in the world...she's loved me her whole life...I wish I could be a hundredth good enough for her. But she loves me...

I've never been to a party like this, I mean I've been to this same party, our company Christmas party. But now I'm sitting at the front table. It's entirely different than sitting in the middle of the masses. Part of me wants to jump up and play, tease all these new possibilities. Hang my toes so close to those uncrossable lines, and thumb my nose at them.
But I'm not going too. I'm not here by myself. Thinking about how I'm feeling, I'm amazed. Even when I had boyfriends at parties, or even when it's been just Missy and I. It's still been just me, and if I screwed up. It was just me. Now I'm part of us, not me anymore. A part of Missy and Mark, and I would never hurt them. Here at this party, I will risk no possible chance to have any disrespect, or possible censure to come to them. Especially from any of my actions.
It's funny though, when I was talking with the Old man as Mark calls him. Mark wouldn't come and sit right by me, but he watched. I don't know what he thought I would do, flash the old guy right in front of his wife. I would never do that, for one reason is wife is a lady. Just in herself she deserves more respect than that. After all Mark has told us of the Old man, I'll pay him every bit of the respect that Mark thinks is his due, as I'm part of Mark now.
We never said anything to each other but Missy and I split up our time. One of us was always near Mark; he always has a wife at his elbow. The other would be out mingling. We were good corporate wives, just able to do both parts at the same time. We mingled with his managers, secretaries, personal assistants. Then some of our work mates, then switch.
Stay by Mark, smile, look pretty, and talk to the wives of his companions. I drank Ginger Ale for most of the night, unless someone brought me a drink. Missy drank water for most of the night too. We managed Mark too, if what he was talking about wasn't important or he was uncomfortable talking to someone. We moved him along, so no one thought that Mark was avoiding them.
I didn't realize it for awhile but Mary and the Old man were watching us, manage Mark. And they were both smiling, nodding. I don't know if Mark was aware of all the undercurrents, whispers and looks tonight. But there was a lot, a lot of disappointed secretary's. Looks from the younger men ranged from awe to jealousy.
The middle aged couples were mixed. Pretty much okay, some disapproving, some with a smile. The older couples and men were mixed to, but leaned toward some disapproval. In this though I noticed the Group floating, mingling in among them, stroking egos and smoothing feathers. The older wives were the hard ones, as I knew it would be, until I noticed Mary and Alex mingling in among them.
It takes a lot of loyalty and devotion for people to support someone like that. And Mark had it without even asking. It shows what kind of boss and person you are, that so many people covered your back without asking them. A lot of companies can be very cut throat to work in, people fighting for promotions, wages, even just a smile from the big boss. Not this one and I realize that I'm very proud of that fact and of Mark.

Janey and I both got hit on a lot. I don't know if we just attracted others that much or the situation was so confusing with both of us being with Mark. I knew Janey was just that much more beautiful, and I felt real good about myself too. But I think a lot of it was they wanted to test the situation out, of who was with Mark and who wasn't. I know that I tried to be friendly in refusing, but sometimes it just wasn't possible. Then I was hard and fast, and left no doubts.
When the dancing started Janey and I had already talked about that. We danced with Mark, we only danced with Mark. If there was someone we felt we should dance with, for courtesy sake, we would look to Mark. If we couldn't attract Mark's attention, we would use each other.
Someone just asking us to dance, 'no thank you'. Even the Group and some of the Managers, Mark had to clear. Even if he cleared them once, each dance had to be cleared. We didn't dance much but that was all right, we danced with who we really wanted to, Mark. It didn't take long for the idea to get around, and then if someone asked who shouldn't have, they got shot down hard and fast.
Mark found out that the other side of the coin worked out real well too. A very persistent young woman finally dragged him out on the dance floor. They were met by both of our smiling faces, when they got back. I took Mark right back to the dance floor, Janey had a few words with the young lady, turned and left. She never asked again. We only had to do that one more time, and then no one asked again. Women are just so much smarter than men. I escorted Mark over to Mary and asked if she would like to dance with him.
I found the Old Man to be very courteous, polite, and direct;
"Melisa, I had real concerns about Mark in this situation with the two of you, after watching this party. I don't any more. The situation is very unusual, but for you three it works. I hear congratulations are in order. I also hear you have unusual rings, may I see them?"
"You didn't hear enough about them, or you wouldn't have asked. If I were to show you mine, your wife would hit us both. But if you want I'll tell you about them. You are a very old, dear, friend of Mark's so you can hear the story if you want to?"
"Please." But he thought about it for a while.
"Are you familiar with the term of marking a lover?"
"Yes."
"Our first night together as lovers, we marked each other. With a bite mark on the very lower belly, one from each of us. I wanted mine to be permanent and I expressed the idea, of getting them tattooed in. It grew from there. The rings were added, then names on the interior of the bands. First when we were talking it was going to be just our rings to each other.
Then it grew into marriage rings, they are there, mine is Markus and Janey. The others are the like, Janey and Melisa on Mark, Markus and Melisa on Janey. And yes they are our wedding rings; I'm trying to get Mark to buy us regular rings, to keep the wolves at bay, relatives and such."
I didn't realize it but Mark and Mary had been standing behind us for most of my explanation. So as Janey came up to join us. I thought to have some fun too.
"Would you like to hear the story of how we got the tattoos?"
"Missy don't you dare tell that story!" Mark's already three shades of red.
"Well if she won't I will. It's just too much fun!" And Mary can't wait.
"Missy you're a better story teller."
"I'm going to get a big drink!"
"No Mark you need to stay here and keep me honest."
"No I need to get a very big drink, right now!" As he stalks off.
"Janey watch for eavesdroppers, we don't need to embarrass Mark any more than is necessary. Mark had a very rough day that day. We decided we had to do the tattoos before they faded. Janey knew of an artist she wanted to do the work. I know you remember that Janey's an engineer; well she's also an artist too. In taking classes she made friends with a girl named Kim. She promised Kim that if she ever got a tattoo Kim could do it. Janey thought it was a blank promise, she's afraid of needles. She thought she wouldneverget a tattoo."
"You just had to add that part didn't you!"
"Of course, Janey made appointments with Kim that morning, and we went over early morning. It wasn't a good neighborhood, and Mark was worried about his car. He didn't look at the shop name, Janey and I had, and knew it would be a lot of fun so we never told him. Inside he was worried about the shop cleanliness. He didn't notice that anything was wrong until he got into Kim's booth.
First thing he saw was the tiny pink chair, somewhere between a ladies exam chair and dentists. Then he noticed that there were about a dozen women in the shop and all the tattoo artists are women. Then he noticed the name of the shop 'The Sapphic Heart', big pink heart with an arrow through it. It was a lesbian shop, Janey never knew that Kim might have been, and we're still not sure."
By this time the Old Man has a smile from ear to ear, and Mary is laughing so hard there's tears' flowing down her cheeks.
"By now our 6ft 10in Italian stud realizes that he's going to have to drop his pants in front of a dozen women, in a lesbian shop, and get a tattoo right by his...you know. By his turn, and he had to go last, they're all ready for him. I think they even called in reinforcements. He thought he was going to be real smart and not take his pants all the way off. He had sweat pants on that he just lowered as far as he had to, and then tightens the draw string.
He was feeling pretty smart then. Until Kim had to shave him, and that was so funny, he looked like he thought she was going to cut it off. He thought the worse was over after that. It was just getting the tattoo done now. He was a little nervous when little Kim got right down by his...well you know.
I better tell you about Kim. She's no bigger than me, only slim like Janey, and she's got Janey's hair down to a tee. Long and blond, but you guys think my eyes are different. Kim's eyes are different, one like Janey's one like Mark's, yes one green eye and one blue eye. And she's down right by Mark's...you know.
But he's tough and in control. Until Janey starts teasing, and believe me, Janey can tease. She unbuttons her blouse and starts playing with her boobs. She's trying to get him to..."
I bring my fist up and start uncurling my index finger, until it's straight and stiff and as far up as I can pull it up. And everybody roars. Mary is laughing so hard she almost can't set in her chair; even the Old Man has tears on his face. Janey's turned away watching for other people coming over, and her sides are shaking trying not to laugh.
"...well you know. The girls in the shop are laughing so much. And they're taking bets on whether he can make it or not. He's doing pretty well until Janey's playing with one boob, unzips her pants and puts a hand down the front. Oh... Lord we have a tent! In the Sapphic Heart our big Italian stud proves he's a big Italian stud."
The whole Ballroom doesn't know what we're laughing about, but they know it's funny, very funny.

Ha...Ha...Ha, well I knew that the story would come out sooner or later, I just hoped it wouldn't be in front of my Dad or the Old Man, oh well. From getting messages and calls, from the Old Man, I know that Mary's not had much to laugh about for a while, quite a while. Watching her now, I guess I can't bitch too much, she's happy and that's a big plus.
But I'm going to get the last laugh tonight!
"Ha...Ha...Ha, look at all the naughty girls laughing at Santa, I guess you don't want the early Christmas present I was going to give you tonight."
I pause long enough to let the pouts start.
"Well I guess I can be real mean since you laughed at me so much. Maybe I'll show you what you were going to get. Want to see?"
I get a couple of slow sad nods, and I almost feel bad, well OK I feel like a heel. But I know they'll end up happy. So I reach into my pocket and open and lay out the three ring boxes. The big single wedding band in the middle, the outside two have a smaller, thinner wedding bands then a large single point solitaire.
At first everyone just stands there looking. I was going to close them up and put them back in my pocket before I gave them to each of them. But I can't, I see tears start falling from Missy's eyes, those beautiful white blue eyes, and the laser green ones are not far behind. And surprise there's some falling from Mary's too. I can't pick them back up, the laughs not worth it.
"Merry Christmas, my loves."

Oh...God, he got the wedding rings too. Missy and Mary turned into faucets; OK I shed a few too. All three of the wedding bands are the same except in size, and they are gorgeous. Expensive too, platinum and titanium and they are the rings that Kim did on our tattoos. Did I say expensive, I'll say it again. Because the pattern is the one Kim designed, that makes these custom and handmade, even more expensive.
That's just the wedding bands; the solitaires are a fuckin rock. A huge rock, I feel like I need a security guard to follow me around. The solitaire ring itself is as simple as it can get, just a round ring big enough to hold the mount for the stone. You can't even see the mount. On our fingers, all you see is the wedding band and the diamond. The whole set is, simple, striking, and meaningful, being the same as our real rings. The names are engraved on the inside too.
Mark's been thinking about our 'wedding vows'. And I like how he's been thinking. New Years Eve at a chapel, at midnight to say our vows, bringing in the New Year, with a new beginning. I really like it, so did Missy. Since it's not a traditional wedding, we should make our own vows, each of us.
He wanted each of us to think about legal documents, what they needed to be, and what we wanted them to say.
Long ago when Mark was in England, Missy and I had done a joint hair ritual. Naturally we had told Mark about it. He asked to see it tonight, said that he thought it would be beautiful. So we did, and it started in the shower, as it did before. Mark stayed out of the touching, we tried to bring him in, but he just wanted to watch. The only thing he wanted to change was the way we sat. He wanted in that and some of the brushing. His legs are long enough that we could sit in between them. Sideways, with me facing Missy and Mark facing between the both of us. My legs over one of his, then Missy's over mine, and we were all close enough. It was like the triangle that we are, the three points.
He left the drying to us, but he wanted to brush some. As we did before, it gradually started with breast play and kissing. When we were kissing he took over some of the brushing. Little on each of us as we kissed, but again we never hurried, all soft and gentle. Passing the brush back and forth, sometimes to Mark. Kissing and touching progressed to lower touches, finger play. Clit strokes and fingers inside, still easy and slow. As one of us would near orgasm the brush would pass to Mark, after, back to the other girl.
The three of us must have gone for over two hours, just soft climaxes, and hair brushing and Mark watching. When I pushed Missy over onto her back, he moved out of the way. Lips tongue and fingers, she screamed for me. Three times before I let her up, then I screamed for her, several times. We tried to draw Mark into our loving, but he just shook his head.
When we were finished we each took a shoulder of Mark's. I asked him if he wanted to cum in my mouth. He said that he already had cum, just with his heart instead.

Christmas was very small with us this year. We knew Janey's Mom would have nothing to do with our den of sin and iniquity. We planned a big meal here at the house, invited the parents. We invited David too, but said he wasn't expected if it would cause him marital problems. He said that he was sick and tired of her, and he would be here. We also asked that no gifts be exchanged, as we were all adults, it was just a time of celebration.
Between Janey and Mark cooking it was a feast fit for Kings. I set up the formal dining room as beautifully as I could, and Mark had some very good stuff. Three Waterford crystal glasses and a finger bowl of the same, at each place setting. All the plate ware is fine china, entree plate, and two side plates stacked, soup bowl and saucer with soup spoon on saucer. Cup and saucer with coffee spoon, all the flatware was beautiful silver. The fine bone china had a thin silver rim.
Candles in silver holders, deep green place mats, with two linen napkins each. Flowers and an evergreen center piece. The table cloth was special, lace, handmade lace, stark white, and very, very old. I didn't want to use it, but Mark said we had to. His mother will love seeing it; it was made by her great, great something or other grandmother. It was the family Christmas table cloth for generations.
The meal was, without a doubt, the finest meal I've ever had. The dishes Janey and Mark made you couldn't have found outside the finest restaurant in France or Italy. It was a full eight course meal, Janey and I served when necessary. The dinner companions were wonderful, relaxed and full of good conversation. Our third Christmas was very special.
"I know the girls, no ladies and I. Said no gift exchange, and it looks like I'm breaking our own rule. But this is not a gift exchange, this is a celebration gift. From us to you, on New Year's Eve at midnight, we are going to Saint John the Baptist Church on Toole Avenue. And say vows to each other. It will be just us, not actually of the church. There will be no Pastor, just us and our vows to each other, except for those of you here, if you desire to."
Then he passed out ring boxes to each parent.
"They are not what are commonly known as a mother's ring. The rings are divided into three equal sections with the birth stone of each of us, at the equal points. They are a celebration of the circle of the three equal parts of us. The design on the band is the same as our rings. Both our tattoos and our finger rings. They are our gift to you."
He handed David another ring box.
"If you think she would want it."
David handed it back without saying a word.
God I love this man, My Mark.

With the big meal and all the clean up, I'd have bet against any of us having enough energy to 'play around'. But our little bit started it, started us rolling around, playing in our 'pile of puppies'. Mark swatted us both on the ass. So Missy grabbed his cock and bit it, said 'two can play rough, too.' Oh...poor baby I'll kiss it better' and she starts sucking and jerking on his cock.
She tried laughing with it in her mouth and choked. So I took over with a couple of sucks, I was laughing and it didn't work very well for me either. So Missy went back to sucking on it, jacking it with her particular twisting motion and lots of spit. We started doing our pop trick, we knew this cranked Mark up. Missy would suck on what she could of Mark's cock. As she lifted, she sucked as hard as she could, until she literally pulled off the end of his cock with a loud 'pop'. Then I would do the same, back to Missy. Back and forth, it really cranked him up.
I'd been trying to deep throat him for a while now. But he seem to be just too big, Mark had the biggest cock I'd ever seen. So I wasn't surprised I couldn't, but I just kept trying, just playing around with swallowing him. So when I stopped popping off, pushed down and tried to swallow him. Missy wasn't surprised, but she and I were both surprised when he slipped part way into my throat. I pushed a little more and slid deeper.
Missy's eyes were as big around as our dinner plates, 'Janey' she breathed. I held it there for a bit and pulled off to breathe. Went right back down to see if I could keep my throat open enough. And I could, I didn't try to get all of his cock in. I didn't want to get sore and hurt to talk, so I took it slowly.
A little farther each time. As I was up breathing, Missy would suck and go 'pop'. I would suck and swallow down farther. I was having fun, proud of myself, when I came up to breathe once. 'Janey' Missy squealed as she dove for his cock, and the first squirt hit her cheek before she got her mouth over it. I saw it swell and pulse once in her mouth and she passed it back to me.
Swell and pulse, hot in my mouth, and I passed it back to her. Watch it swell and pulse in her mouth, and back to me. This time I let it fill in my mouth, he was close to done anyway, just very small twitches. Done, I showed my open mouth to Missy, with all its cum. Dove back down on Mark's cock. Opened my throat and mouth, letting the cum flow out, and his cock slide farther down my throat. Then we licked it clean.
"I did it, I did it, I did it, I got that big fuckin cock down my throat!

Saint John the Baptist Church is an old church, it reminds me of the cathedrals in Europe. All stone, brick and mortar. Tall trees, steps, and double doors. It's an old church and perfect. Just what I envision, when I think...of a Church.
I don't know how Mark picked or found this Church, but it is perfect. He's gotten the priest to open the doors for us. I thought that someone would want to spend New Year Eve worshiping. But we're the only ones here.
Of the parents that came, it was pretty much as I thought. Mark's Dad is still having some old world philosophy questions, and doubts about what we're doing. But he didn't object to Mark's Mom coming. My parents are here and Janey's Dad. And that's just perfect; I don't want anyone here who isn't supportive of what we're doing.
We don't go up to the pulpit, or the Altar. This isn't a Church function; this is just us before God.
I want to go first and we've all agreed, then Janey, then Mark. We've all written our own vows and not told each other what they are. We used the open area in front of the pews, at the end of the center aisle. I asked that we join hands.
"This is our circle of life. I vow that this will be my circle of life, forever. I'm forever joined with Mark and Janey. They are parts of my body, my mind, and my immortal soul. I vow to do all I can to never hurt, in anyway, this the circle of our lives. The parts of this circle are worth more than my life itself. I vow that I will let nothing come before this circle of life. This circle of life is my bedrock. I vow to do all I can to support this circle and all its parts toward, love, health, growth, and happiness. This circle of life is part of me, forever, this I vow."
"Wow, that's kind of cool. You used a circle, Missy, I used a ring."
"A ring is an unbroken line, with no beginning and no end, which goes on forever. I vow to be part of this ring, of Missy, Mark and I, forever. In this ring, there is no I, it's us, and will be us forever. I vow to never put anything before this ring of us. I vow to love, honor, and cherish, all parts of our ring. I vow to never hurt the ring that is us, or any of its parts. I vow to use all that I am, to support all parts of our ring, with everything I have and am. I vow to forever be part of the ring of us."
"The symbol of a marriage has been a wedding band worn on the third finger of the left hand. Our wedding bands are written on our body, on our mind, on our souls, permanently. I vow to always be part of the circle of us, Missy, Janey and I, forever. A circle that goes on for all time. I vow to support, love, and honor and cherish all parts of our circle. All of me will be forever in our circle to be used for all that we need. The ring of us is first in me, at the center of me, and will be at the end of me. Nothing will ever mean more to me than the ring that is us. I vow nothing will ever come before the ring of us. I vow that I will forever be part of the ring of us, Melisa, Janey, and Markus...forever."
The vows in the Church didn't take very long, less than an hour. What with arriving, setting up where we wanted to, getting everyone into places that they wanted, and the talk of everyone after the vows. It was less time than I thought it would be.
All of our legal papers that we'd agreed on were done. Mostly just interconnecting wills for us and any future children, or heirs. Powers of attorney that are between all of us, with each other, and a contract of intent. Mark had an attorney that was a friend of his, which did everything for us.
It was all done; we were as married as we could make it.
But all of it didn't matter; we were married in our own minds, that first night. And our tattoos just completed it. Plus we knew that it was forever. I guess that's why it's taken us so long to finish getting married. Getting all the I's dotted and the T's crossed, just a little over three years since our first night.

It's done, now the fun part, the honeymoon. And we did it up good, Montego Bay Jamaica. Sun, Sand, Beaches, fucking, eating, dancing, all of it. Live music every night with dancing on the beach. Grass hut cabanas, with hanging beds, a case of sun block for Missy. It was a resort with six restaurants, Thai, French Bistro, Five Star formal dining, Sea Food, Pizza, even an English Pub with darts, fish & chips, beer.
It had almost anything you could want, this middle class girl got a real taste of the good life, and I loved it. It had a couple of swimming pools with walk up bars in the middle. A massage and spa, to spoil you. Anything you wanted to do for activities on the water, or in the water. And we tried most of them, scuba diving, sailing on racing sloops, catamarans. Snorkeling for fish and turtles, dolphins, we tried it all.
But the best was our villa, oh my ...god. It was called a love nest villa, and I've never seen a more beautiful, fabulous, gorgeous building in my life. Everything was craftsmanship, high polished hard woods. Brass fixtures, high end furniture, everything was top of the line. It was small, just our one bedroom, but it was a full house with everything else. Huge king size bed, walk in shower, phone, TV, only it was onstiltsout in the cove, over the ocean. It had several decks on stilts, an infinity pool on one. A Jacuzzi on another, with hanging hammocks over the ocean. Our own sun deck, everything faced out to sea and with no near neighbors. You didn't have to wear clothes if you didn't want to, and most of the time we didn't want to.
One of my favorite things to do was at the end of our bed. At night you could turn on the underwater lights below the glass floor in our bedroom. Looking over the foot of our bed, I'd lie on my belly, tip my hips up and have Mark slowly fucking me, and we would watch the fish.
Missy cuddled and lay beside me, and I could have my hand in her pussy. We would play and fuck and cum. Watching the fish, Missy would come on my fingers, I would cum. Then we would switch, Mark in Missy, her fingers in me, and we would cum again. When Mark would cum filling one of us, the other would lick her clean and start all over again.
Missy loved one of the loungers, Mark would sit in it. Missy would slide onto his cock and lay with her back against his chest, watching out into the ocean. Mark could play with her breasts or clit and she would cum and scream. I would sit watching them or lick the both of them, Missy came hard this way. I loved a swinging chair on the deck, would sit riding Mark's cock, swinging, watching out to sea. It was fun, I would get close to cumming and Mark would spin the chair faster and faster. I would cum screaming, laughing, and screaming. Missy and I made love to each other in every way possible, several times a day, and Mark loved to watch. He said it gave him orgasms in his heart.
I didn't know you could do that, cum, laughing at the same time. But we all did it, it was just that kind of time and mood, we played. In the sand, on the beach, in the ocean we played, and laughed. The people of the resort and the guests loved us. No whispers behind the hand, raised eye brows, or looks down someone's nose. They called us the lovers. We laughed, they laughed, we played in the sand, and someone played with us. We drank with them, danced with them, and they loved us.
Missy had a Jamaican man; he would come up to her, ask the little Missy girl how many times she fucks today, and laugh and laugh. Missy would turn forty shades of red, lean over and whisper in his ear, ten. And they would laugh and laugh.
We had our own personal butler, if we didn't want to go in to eat or dance. Call ahead and we would eat at our love nest villa. If we wanted to go to the resort, he would pick us up in a little four wheel cart. I think he would have gotten us anything we wanted.
We didn't want much; we played in our love nest villa, in the ocean, naked. A lot of the time, we'd be dancing on the beach most every night; we could dance just the three of us together. I don't think that either of us got hit on the whole two weeks we were there, we ran around half naked almost the whole time, and no one bothered us. It was a perfect time, the perfect time of us.
We knew it had to come to an end, we got home and I knew I'd over done it. I could tell I was going to get sick. Ever since I was a little girl I could tell if I was going to get sick, and I was and I knew it would be bad.

I don't know why we did it this way, Missy had canceled her lease on her apartment even before she fell in that hall way and ended up in the hospital. Janey had moved in here only a few days later. Over three years later and we still had Janey's apartment. We'd never leased it out; all we'd ever used it for was some overflow times. Gray used it for a little while when his house was getting painted. Once Tom and Alex used it because too many relatives came to a party they had. I'd used it a couple of times for visiting company personal who didn't want a hotel.
Certainly not enough to have paid for it for three years. But getting back from our honeymoon, Janey moved back in there. She said she knew she was going to get sick, very sick. Missy confirmed that Janey has the ability to tell if she's getting sick, before she gets sick. Janey said that she didn't know what was going to make her sick, but she didn't want to spread it to us.
I don't know if I believed that she could tell how sick she was going to get, Missy did. Even her doctor did, he prescribed her antibiotics and codeine cough medicine. She stocked up on Pepto-Bismol, Tylenol, and Ibuprofen. It sounded like she was getting ready for a war. She knew her body though; she got sick, very sick.
Missy or I called her several times a day, after the first week I wanted to call in a nurse, she said no. Mid way into the second week she started getting better. A couple of days later Missy and I had to go to a company dinner. We got a little drunker than we should have, we felt so sorry for Janey. We decided to sneak in and cuddle her.
Of course a drunk can't sneak and she heard us. Since she was giggling, we knew she was feeling better. Even stripped off naked and with little bit Missy. With big ass me, three in a queen sized bed is full. I was going to cuddle and go to sleep, little bit had other ideas. After two weeks 'Janey must be horny', so it was fingers, tongue, nipples and teeth. Janey came for her, screaming, twice. After she moved to spoon Missy, she wanted me, in her.
After cumming for Missy she was wet enough, so spooning on our sides. Working in and out, little by little, and I was buried in Janey. I thought we were going to go to sleep, Missy was telling us about her firefly dreams. Every little bit Janey would push back onto me, sliding in and out. Stop, only to do it again in a little while. Soon she was squeezing with her pelvic muscles, moving constantly.
I knew she wasn't going to go to sleep. Using long slow strokes, I started fucking her back. A big deep sigh, 'yes...just like that', and we slowly rocked back and forth. Long deep strokes, not going hard into her just long, slow and deep. Both of us lasted a long time, Missy was asleep. And we kept rocking, slow and deep, when I felt Janey tighten. Then groan and tighten more. I released and filled her.
When I came it was different. Most orgasms for guys are pretty much the same, from watching the girls. I can't say the same; they seem to be able to have several different kinds of orgasms. But a guy, pretty much the same, sometimes harder. Or the contractions stronger, but it's basically the same, except tonight. It felt like a water hose and a valve. Someone slowly opened the valve and it poured out, then they started closing the valve. Changed their mind and opened it back up, changed their mind again, and closed it.
I stayed in Janey, and thought about it. Wondering about it, I noticed Janey fell asleep. I was still thinking about it when I faded out, still in Janey.

I think our honeymoon did something to us. We're horny all the time now. I thought that it was because there were three of us; we always had sex on the bed before. Not after our honeymoon! One day Mark pushed all the dinner dishes together and took Janey right on the kitchen table, while I watched. Pulled her pants down, bent her over the table and fucked her from behind. And it was hot, and she loved it.
Mark was in his home office working. I was on the couch reading a book, when Janey came and turned me around, pulled my panties off, spread my legs and ate me right there. My screams brought Mark out to watch us finish, and he was laughing at us. Mostly because Janey's head was out of sight under my skirt.
At night if one of us was tired, they went to sleep, If the others made love and got rough or noisy. They woke up, watched until it quieted down, and went back to sleep. We're more comfortable in each other now.
Janey announced, she was horny and wanted some excitement, 'we're going shopping'. As soon as we got to the mall, I knew it was going to be different. Walking in Janey was hot, strutting, powerful and confident. She picked out her shoe store with a younger salesman. She dropped into her shy, casual act. And started to play, her almost looks down her blouse. Skirt pulled up not quite enough, and tucked between her legs, just quick enough as she sat back down. Looking over at him from the side of her face, and then leaning down to look at the shoes on her feet. Her long hair swings in front of the sagging neck line.
He stopped, stared, shuttered, and kept staring. Her dresswasn'ttucked between her legs, and he was looking right at her bare pussy! She asked for another pair of shoes, he got up to get them, Walked to the back room with a very obvious bulge in his pants and he didn't notice the people staring at him. He must have been as hard as a rock, because it stuck out!
But when he came back he had the shoe box held in front of him, and the reddest face. After he put the shoes on, Janey pulled her hairout of the wayand bent to admire the shoes on her feet. Looked up to watch him stare down the front of her blouse at her bare tits! And she smiled, toed the shoes off and walked out of the store. To Mark and I watching with our mouths hanging open.
She had never showed before. Her dance was always a tease of almost. But she had the most satisfied smile on her face. She went looking for another store.
Mark
*******
I couldn't believe it; Janey showed him her bare tits and pussy. Obviously showed him and watched him look. And now she's grinning like the cat that ate the cream. Missy tried to get her reason for doing it, 'she felt like it'. And 'it was fucking hot too'. She headed off to look for another store.
I thought it might be good to get her calmed down before she did. So I suggested we ought to go have lunch, the waiter thought he'd hit the jackpot. The tease was almost, almost, just a quick peek. Then back to almost, and Missy couldn't keep from giggling. I couldn't keep the stupid grin off my face. Until she got me involved. She started holding my hand, when the waiter came to the table again. She lifted my hand up and put it on her breast and squeezed. He stared, shuttered, and almost spilled her water glass. Missy giggled, Janey laughed and I was three shades of red, so was he. The only thing I asked her was to not flash the Group.
Then she went looking for the next shoe store. Instead she happen to walk by a Victoria Secret store and I wasn't going in, no absolutely not, no not going in...After we were in the store she started to model some night wear 'for me'. Yeah right, at first it was pretty tame, Satin and Silk, pretty things, small tops with boy shorts.
I think she was just getting the store clerk used to her modeling for us. The clerk went to show something to another customer and a sheer baby doll nightie came out, clear into the store. Quick spin and back into the dressing room. I think two guys ran into clothes racks. The next out was a long silk robe, held together with one hand, a quick turn, a flash of one bare breast. Back to the dressing room. I sent Missy in to drag her out before we got arrested.
When we got home I'm glad there was two of us!

Now I know what some women would consider rape. Plus I know what the expression, 'she tried to fuck me to death' means. Janey gave us very graphic examples of those two things. I know that I've never had my clothes ripped off before; I think we'll be finding buttons for awhile!
When my back hits the bed, my pants were gone, my shirt was ripped open! My bra pushed up over my tits,parts of my panties were still on, and Janey buried her face into my pussy! Lifted her ass in the air, turned to Mark with a, 'fuck me hard, just slam it in and fuck me hard'!
He must have listen to her, every push in, was a grunt from Janey and a nose trying to push its way inside me. It was so fast and abrupt I was having a hard time getting into it. Not so with Janey, as she throws her head back and howls, cumming and howling. Barely stops and tells Mark, 'more'.
Finally I just laugh and relax, and the heat starts building. Before I can get there though. Mark grunts and roars and Janey follows screaming. She flops over to her back, 'lick me, lick me'. And I try, I honestly try, until Mark pushes into me and I have a hard time thinking. We don't do me from behind on my knees very often, it goes in deep. It gets to the bottom of me. Before it runs out of Mark, and I have to be in the right head space or it hurts. And I must be in the right head space, because it definitely doesn't hurt.
Janey grabs my head and pulls it down to her, 'lick me, lick me'. I can, because Mark was still hard from fucking Janey when he pushed into me. Now he's gone a little soft and is not hitting the end of me very hard. I can think enough to lick and suck on Janey, draws little mews and coos from her. I don't get her to come before Mark's rock hard again, and is hitting the end of me. Thinking becomes hard again, I keep trying, but I know I'm not going to get her off, make her cum.
Mark's hitting the end of me with a steady rhythm. It's building that ball down low in my center. Pounding it, building it, bigger and bigger. He won't quit pounding it, building it, and it won't pop. I feel it swell, swell, and it explodes. And I scream, cum, screaming, and feel the flood as I pour down Mark's cock, and my thighs. Pulse and I pour out again, cumming, squirting. My legs and muscles go all wonky, and I can't hold myself up, and I fall face first onto Janey's belly.
She pushes me off her, turns on her hands and knees, and pushes her ass back to Mark. Groans as he slides deep into her, flops face down to the bed. Ass in the air and his hands grab her hips, as he starts with long deep strokes. She grunts and groans with almost every stroke into her. She reaches up and pulls my ankle, pulling me toward her.
Toward her mouth, that starts licking the juice off of my thighs. She's grunting with every thrust into her. Pulling me inward to her tongue, and tries burrowing it up inside me. As she starts licking and sucking my clit, the grunts are still coming with each stroke. Her head falls on me, 'oh fuck, oh fuck...OH FUCK' as head back she cums again. Her head falls onto me, panting, gasping. I hear 'more' and she goes back to eating me. It's a surprise one, as it clenches, grabs and rips through my belly. Pushing the scream out my mouth.
'Yes...grunt...yes...grunt, AH FUCK, and Janey's cumming again. 'More' her heads just lying on my belly, and the grunts keep coming. I can't help but run my fingers through her beautiful hair, as I feel every push into her and every grunt into my belly. 'Yes...grunt...yes...fuckfuckfuckFUCK, and she's cumming again. I feel her pants and gasps on my belly, but I notice Mark's rhythm starts breaking.
So does Janey, she spins around and dives with her mouth onto Mark's cock. Down, down until I know she has to stop. Down some more, until I think her face will hit his belly. But she jerks off gagging, spit trailing off his cock. She dives right back down, down. And jerks up gagging trailing spit and cum. A deep, deep groan from Mark, and she's diving down again. Staying down I can see her throat work, swallowing.
She pulls back knowing he's done, wiping her face off. Rising to her knees, looking into Mark's eyes, running a hand through his hair.
"God...I love you husband!"
"I love you Missy my wife!"
We all slide into bed, whispers, touches, love words and holding each other. Moving, touching, and cuddling as Janey is the first to fall into sleep. Mark and I lay staring into each other's eyes, his hand's running fingers through her beautiful hair. As I watch his eyes float shut and he sinks into sleep too.
As I slide down, watching my little firefly, I'm wondering about her. She doesn't dance anymore, she's hunting, hunting. I don't know what she's hunting; I would help her if I could...
Mark
*******
Work has just been blitzing me lately. I don't know if I'll have to make a trip to get it straighten out. I hope not, if I do that just means it's really messed up and someone didn't do their job. I don't know what it is, but I have this nagging feeling in the back of my mind that something is wrong. I think it might be with Janey, she's been acting so nervous lately. But if you ask her, she just smiles and says nothing's wrong. Goes around with a smile on her face for awhile. Until she thinks I'm not watching her anymore, then she's nervous again. I asked and Missy gets the same response.
I know that I'll have to take work home tonight.
Janey
*******
I just couldn't wrap my head around it! I, me, Janey was pregnant!! It wasn't supposed to be me; it was suppose to be Missy! She wanted kids; she'll be a great mother! Not me, I'll be a lousy mother, just look who I have for an example.I never wanted children, well maybe when I'm thirty five, forty or so.But not now!
Sitting here in my car, outside the doctor's office. I can't get my breath, my hearts pounding so hard. All I can hear is the, thump-thump-thump, of blood in my ears. I don't even know how I got to my car! My mind's just numb.
We've never talked about kids. I know we have our tats and rings, the vows we said to each other. More than that I don't know! I don't know if Mark wants children or how many.Mark's going to be a father, does he even want to, I DON'T KNOW!
I haven't even told them why I'm here, at the doctor's office. Even with that home pregnancy test, I never said anything. It was just so ridiculous, me being pregnant! I never fail to take my birth control pills, never! But I guess it didn't matter. I'M PREGNANT!
I don't really even think about not keeping it, he, she. It's a life; I know mom's a religious freak. But this one thing I agree with her on, it's a life.
Mark, Missy and I made love, all of us together. Made love and made this...baby. This new person, so maybe it's not just mine, it's all of ours. And I have to get home to them, have to tell them... But I can't drive, I don't even know how I got to my car, how I left the doctor's office, how I walked here! It's just blank, I know I can't drive! I dig in my purse for my phone, hands are shaking so badly! I drop it, onto the floor of the car. Pick it up, and drop it immediately again. I can't help screaming, I know I'm crying! I can't stop that, crying. After two tries I manage to call a cab.
As soon as I get in, the cabbie immediately wants to know if I'm OK, hell no I'm not OK! But I tell him I am, just some upsetting news. That I need to get home right away. Please just go, fast. I know I'm freaking him out. I'm not sobbing or crying now, just the tears won't stop running. I can feel how wet my face is, my mind is just numb. Sitting, waiting until I can get home, to Missy and Mark.
In the front door I see Missy reading on the couch.
"MARK!"
"Janey what's wrong?" but I don't answer her.
"MARK!"
This time I hear the footsteps come running from his office. They're both pale, wondering what I'm screaming about. I don't know how to tell them, and I'm scared of what Mark's going to think. I suppose every woman who's ever had to tell a man, that he's going to be a father. Has battled this, these doubts; is he going to be happy, is he going to reject me, is he going to throw me out, scream at me, deny it's his. All the horror story reactions we've heard of, goes through a woman's mind. Then there's Missy, what's she going to feel like? That I'm trying to take Mark away for myself, jealous it's not hers. Angry at me, reject me, I don't know. But I guess there's no good way to tell them, just dump it out.
"I'm pregnant"
It's like the whole world stopped, someone hit the pause button. We just stand there looking at each other. The tension is so high in me, I'm not even breathing, can't. I can still feel the tears running down my cheeks, but I'm not sobbing or crying. Just waiting, not breathing, and not moving.
Missy's the first one to move, she squeals, with a huge smile, she jumps into my arms.
"YES...that's fantastic. We're going to have a baby. A Janey baby, I love it...love...love...love it!!"
I'm watching Mark, over Missy's shoulder, and I see a smile start to creep into his face. His head starts nodding, and the smile widens to cover his whole face. I feel as if someone poked me with a pin, and the tension just runs out of me. He gives a small fist pump.
"Yes...yes I like that, no I love that. I want that, I've always wanted a big family. After all I'm Italian, we always have big families. And this is just the first one. I'm happy Janey, very happy."
Mark grabs us both, lifts us, and starts dancing around the floor. Missy and I are not even touching the floor, dancing. We're all laughing, giggling, floating around the room. Missy flops onto the couch, but I can't sit down. My bodies too wired, I finally quit flowing tears and can feel the smile on my face. See the same on Missy's and Marks.
"What happened, Janey? I know you never; never miss a birth control pill."
"Remember when I was sick? The doctor said that sometimes; certain brands of birth control pills, certain brands of antibiotics, react with the internal chemistry of a certain person. That cancels out the birth control. That's what must have happened. We just got caught in that perfect storm of conditions. And I got pregnant.
"Well I love it! I can't wait to tell my folks, their first grandchild. A bambino for our family."
I'm watching Missy, then motion to Mark. Missy's watching something in the air. Something like a bug flying around. She stands up, still watching, but I can't see anything. I look to Mark, he can't see anything either. She steps up close to me, watching my stomach. Reaches, putting both hands on my belly, where the baby would be. Looks up to us, flashing a thousand watt smile and laughing, laughing eyes.
"The firefly, she's here! Janey she's here...OH!" Her eye brows scrunch up. And I startscreaming, screaming!
"MISSY...MISSY...NO."
Mark
******
I jerk to catch her, even before her body starts to sag. But I know it's already too late. The place where my forever love lived in my soul isempty. Missy's gone, my little porcelain doll, my forever love isgone. Even before her weight settles into my arms, I know she will never be with us again.
I hear, way in the back of my mind, Janey start screaming, and screaming Missy's name over and over. But it doesn't seem very loud, I know it is. What I feel in the front of my mind from Janey is her,DEEP...DEEPDESPAIR. She knows Missy's gone too. I can feel that certainty from both of us, she is gone. I can feel what Janey is feeling, and I know she can feel what I am too.
As I lay Missy's body down, Janey's still screaming. I can feel her getting hysterical, and that won't help anything.
"Janey, help me!" But she just keeps screaming
"Janey, help me!" it makes no difference, just screaming. So I slap her!
"CALL 911 RIGHT NOW!" and she runs.
I start doing CPR on Missy's body; I know it won't do any good. But I have to, to try. It's not long and I can feel Janey watching me.
"Get down here and breathe for her!"
She jumps, slides down and starts helping. We keep doing CPR, waiting for help to arrive. Janey stops, for a second, looks up to me.
"You know it's too late, too, don't you?"
"Yes...but I have to try, have to do something!"
I HAVE to do SOMETHING! That's all that's keeping me here. I can tell that it's not real to us yet. It's just so impossible, she's my forever love! She can't be GONE. I have to stay here; I can't just stop and sink into my despair. Janey's worse than I am, it's no more real to her right now, then it is to me. But her mind is shattered; it's almost to where she can't think! Both of us are still functioning, because it's not real yet, it's just too impossible!
So we keep working on Missy's body, it's not long and sweat's dripping, running off us. Waiting for the EMT's, help to arrive. When the ambulance pulls up, gets the gurney out, then back in. We both try to jump in with Missy.
"Only family can ride in with the patient."
"Wife." We simultaneously reply.
"Can't, CPR in the back. There's no room, Meet us at Mercy Hospital." A voice from inside the ambulance says. Doors slam and they speed away, lights flashing, siren wailing.
In the car to the hospital, I'm worried. My mind's numb and I feel like I can't, don't want to care about anything. Missy's gone! But I also can feel how Janey's hanging on by the barest of threads. Her mind's shattered, going in a hundred different directions. Iknowshe's going to lose it, I just don't know howbadandwhen.
My minds in a loop; Missy's gone, Missy's gone, my forever love is gone. Missy's gone, once in awhile I can grab a thought, of what I have to do, where I have to go. Then it's back to Missy's gone. Finally I get a thought I can grab and hold on to. The baby, our baby and Janey.
I remember that I've heard a woman can lose the baby, real early in a pregnancy, because of her emotional trauma or stress. So I grab on to that, decide that's my job, the thing I have to do. Keep Janey and the baby safe and together. Focus on that; use that to keep me going. Because if I don't have something, some job, I'll lose it too. And never be able to get it back. I know my Missy's gone, my Missy's gone forever.
At the hospital, we don't have long to wait. Plus our 'wife' comment must have beaten us here. They don't ask whose family, any of that. They just pull us both into a little room by the ER area. It's not a waiting room; it's more like a counsel room, a chapel room. So they must know it's too late too, but they're still working.
I know of another job I have to do, so I call Missy's Dad.
They get here before the doctors come back. I hope against hope that it will help Janey, Missy's folks being here, but I doubt it. Janey's getting closer and closer to completely losing it. I can feel her mind, it's getting more fragmented and blank the longer this takes. But I'm going to be close to her, when the doctors get here.
But get here they finally do.Massive Cerebral Aneurysm, that's what took my forever love away. They said it was like several large strokes all at once. Some of it might have been congenital, but more just cascaded. It could have happen at any time, even in her sleep, it was just time. They said it's impossible to see ahead of time. They said she probably never even felt anything. Because of the size of the area, she never could have survived. They said she died instantly.
Janey and I already knew that, we felt her leave us.
All the time he's been talking, Janey's been sobbing. But now she's started hic-hic, gulping air, first softly then louder and louder. Then she starts wailing, screaming. I've been waiting for it, ready.
As soon as she starts, I wrap her in my arms and start whispering in her ear. Nothing I say seems to help, so I lightly cover her mouth. Keep whispering. 'Janey, Missy needs you, stay here.' 'Missy needs your help, baby needs your help'. Still no response, she's just not in her mind. It's not like when I felt Missy go, this is just a blankness, a white zone. Every time I say Missy or baby, I get a twitch in her mind. So in desperation I put baby and Missy together and get Baby Missy. 'Baby Missy needs you, Janey'; 'Baby Missy can't live without you.' Finally just Baby Missy, Baby Missy over and over again. She's still trying to scream into my hand, but she's looking at me. Into my eyes and she's there, in her mind. Just then the nurses get there with a sedative, and she's out, asleep.
Right away I grab the doctor, tell him she's just today found out she's pregnant. About a month, month and a half along at most. That I fear for the baby, fear she might lose it, if she's too traumatized or goes into shock. I ask please, if she can stay in the hospital for observation, if I can stay with her, I'm the father. So that's what we do.
After Janey's in a room, I get with Missy's Dad and Mom. Hug them, cry a lot. Talk about what needs done. What I want done, tell them, anything for Missy, anything, no matter the cost. The very best, I'll pay for it all. I ask them for a very large favor, tell them money doesn't matter.
I ask if they'll let me buy three burial plots in a row, put Missy in the middle, please. For us, the three of us, I think Missy would want it that way. Tell them that I'll try to get Janey's Dad to help, maybe help pick out the plots. I'll try and get Tom and Alex to help too. Maybe some of the Group can do something, anything that's needed.
But I need to be with Janey. Janey and the baby, that's what's important now, to keep them safe, whole.That's my job!
I realize that I'm just rattling, talking. I don't know if I'm making any sense. Ineedto get things done, make arrangements, and take care of things. I know it's what Missy used to laugh at, my drive to do the job, my need to handle everything. She laughed, told me I'd never sit still with something undone, some job to do. But it's the only thing keeping me here! My Missy's gone!
I needto get to Janey, keep her and the baby safe!
When I got into Janey's room, it was the first time I could start to think. That has its good and bad, I had to force myself. Force myself away from that pit, that deep pit of despair, Missy's gone. My soul wants to runaway, fall into that pit, away from that reality of, 'Missy's gone', and the pain.
But my mind says that Janey needs me so I can't run. Janey and Baby Missy need me. Poor child she's already named. I'm absolutely positive it's going to be a girl. Missy called it, 'Janey she's here.' When I was trying to bring Janey back, Baby Missy came to me so easily, felt so right, and it was all Janey would respond to. Not just Missy's name, Janeyalwayscame to Missy's call before, not just baby either. Only Baby Missy was what she responded to.
That's not the main thing I'm thinking about. I try thinking of anything to stay out of that pit of despair.
There's something very strange, almost scary going on. Something mystical, between and to, Janey and I.
Iknewtheexact instantthat Missy passed. It was so completely unexpected, her passing, but I knew in that instant.So did Janey, both of us had grabbed her evenbeforeher body started to sag! It passed between us in another instant, that she was dead, permanently dead. I knew it; Janey knew it, withabsolute certainty.
The strange part was further; the tie between us, IknewJaney knew it, sheknewthat I knew it too. The circle continued in our knowledge, that we weretrulyfeeling each other's mind. We could literally feel the moods and emotions of the others mind. Not the thoughts exactly, we couldn't read each other's minds, just feel the emotions.
As I rolled and rolled this around in my mind, I not only thought about what it might be, but the why too. When I thought of it like that, I started calling it. Missy's Gift, her last gift to us, Janey and I. We never had anything like this until Missy's death. In that instant I think it was born, when we both felt Missy die.
Janey and I never had the connection that Missy and Janey did, or Missy and I. If Missy had not been there at the start of us, I don't think Janey and I would have ever matched up. Missy drew us together, and was the glue that held us together. When she passed, I don't know, for sure, that we would have. Or even could have stayed together.
I believe as she died she gave us, Missy's Gift. A very different connection, but no less as strong a tie. Sure I love Janey and I know she loves me. But in the pain and trauma of Missy's death, I don't know if we could have held together. With this gift, I don't know how we could part!
I didn't even think about this new ability, I just used it. In the car, I knew what was happening in Janey's mind, and she could feel me 'watching' her. In the ER, I knew she was going to 'lose' it. As she started 'losing it', I could see what was happening, in her mind. She was going catatonic; it wasn't just an emotional breakdown. I could 'see' that blank white zone. And IknewI had to get her back,right then. If she would have stayed in that zone, she might never come back. She felt, that she had nothing to live for!
For most of her life, Missy was her life, the focus of Janey's life. She felt she had nothing left, to live for!
They kept Janey in the hospital until we had to go to Missy's funeral. I never left her side; I felt that I didn't dare. She was too fragile. But I knew she would never forgive me if I made her miss it, Missy's funeral. So I had Alex pick up clothes for Janey and me, and brought them to the hospital. We got ready right there.
Missy's folk's could not have been better, we were family. Janey and I sat with them in the first pew at the chapel, sat with them at the grave site. That was where the trouble started. The priest had no sooner stopped speaking. Then Janey's mother rose.
"THIS IS RIGHTEOUS. THIS IS GOD'S PUNISHMENT FOR THEIR SINS!"
Everyone froze; they couldn't believe someone would say something so hurtful and foul. In front of parents who were burying their child. Everyone but Janey that is, even as close as I was watching her mind, I didn't catch her. As much as I was watching her body, I froze too. Janey flew toward her mother and punched her. Not a girly slap or a child like swing, a full blown prize fighter punch, right to the face. I heard cartilage crush, bones break, and blood flew. All I felt from Janey was rage, red, red, rage. Her mother fell and Janey fell on top of her, with both knees to the chest. And more bones broke. Janey's hand was broken; you could see bones sticking out. But she was beating her mother with it. She was going to kill her, that's what I felt from Janey. Killing rage, but I had to scream too. Because when I grabbed Janey off her mother. That's when I lost her; she went limp in my arms. In her mind was just that, DEAD BLANK WHITE ZONE!!
Janey had left! I tried everything, nothing worked. No twitch, no flicker in her mind. JustNOTHING!
They kept her in the main hospital for a couple weeks. They said it was amazing, that she hadn't lost the baby. That even if things didn't change, her body would deliver, even in her condition. I told myself that was never going to happen;Janey was going to come back. If it was the last thing I ever did, the last dime I could spend. She was going to be back before Baby Missy was born.That was my job.
Then they transferred her to a 'mental care facility'. I didn't like it, butthey saidthe mental care hospital could take better care of her. That the doctors there could help her more, I didn't like it, so I watched. I barely left her side, tried to always touch her, talked to her. About good times we had with Missy, about Baby Missy, also of our future with our baby. Most nights I slept in the chair by her side, holding her hand.
Just after everything had happened, I had gone back to the house we had lived in. I couldn't stand it. So I temporarily moved into Janey's place. After a month the Group moved all my stuff out of the old house. Put most into storage, left most of the big things in the house. I kept our bed.
I sold the house. The Group really bailed me out at work. I was there some of the time, but I wasn't really functional. Everything got done, they're solid. In the early part of the third month I bought a new house. Alex and Janey's Dad, David, were fantastic, they did the leg work. All I had to do was the final selection and sign the papers. I picked one with a very large first floor bedroom, with another smaller bedroom right by it. The Group moved me back in.
That 'mental care facility' was just trying different drugs on her. They were feeding her, washing her, ready for the long haul, I wasn't. So I pulled her out, took her home with me. Installed her and everything she needed into that large bedroom, with a live-in nurse in the smaller one. Hired 24 hour nursing care, with a doctor to come in and provide care for her. Also a housekeeper /cook to care for them all.
Mostly it was up to us; me, her Dad, Alex, and Missy's parents, occasionally my Mom.
One of us was always there, with her, sometimes several of us. The only time she wasn't with other people, was in the very middle of the night. Then it was just her and I in our bed, our bed from the before time. We touched her; talked to her, read to her, moved her limbs, rolled her over, sat her up, screamed at her, in the middle of the night, I cried for her and me. We pushed her, pulled her, jerked her, and begged her to...react to us. Ithinkshe knew when I was there, sometimes. Her face would turn toward me, but her eyes were still dead blank. Other than that, NOTHING!
It was late in the fifth month; I was at work, talking to Tom and Gray. I got up running!
"JANEY'S AWAKE. Cover for me!"
I left on a dead run, broke every traffic rule in the book. But I got there, and she was awake. I scared everyone, crashing in through the door and tearing into Janey's room. Her Dad and the nurses had been in the kitchen talking and didn't know she'd roused.
"Mark, I can smell Missy in the bed!"
I fell on her, crying and laughing at the same time. She started crying too. We were tied together in that feeling. Crying for what we had lost, laughing for what I'd gained back, Janey.
"Mark, this isn't our house!"
"I went back once, Janey, but I couldn't live there again."
"I don't think I could have either Mark."
"I'm so big."
"It's been five months Janey!"
"OH."
Early in the seventh month, we were married in a very small wedding. The same chapel we used for our vows, and Missy's funeral. Just; my folks, her Dad, Missy's parents, Tom and Alex, the rest of the Group. We had to be 'convinced' to marry. As far as Janey and I were concerned, we already were. We had our rings and vows, we'd done with Missy. We didn't want to show them, I guess the guys had already seen mine. As usual Alex wouldn't let it go. So Janey showed her, said it didn't look the same with her big belly. But we did marry. The parents convinced us because of Baby Missy.
Janey looked hard for a true name, and we finally found one we both liked. My Mom told us.
Melisa Lucciola Giovanni was born. Eight pounds eleven ounces, 4:30 am. Four days before Missy's birthday. Janey was trying for the birthday, but babies never listen. Lucciola is firefly in Italian.
Epilogue
Mark
*******
Exactly to the day, one year after Missy's death, Janey and I had wreaths tattooed around the ones with Missy's ring in them. We started out calling our daughter, 'Missy' but it hurt too much and it didn't seem right. Plus she's never going to look or act like Missy. Even at less than one year old, you can tell she's her mother's daughter. If her hair stays the same, she is going to be exotic as well as beautiful. Laser green eyes, skin's a little darker than her Mom's. But it's that white hair that will mark her out. It's already longer than it should be.
Janey wanted to cut hers, her long beautiful golden hair. I didn't, so I told her I would take over Missy's job of making love to Janey's hair. I know I would never be as good, or meant as much, as when Missy did it. But I would try, so she didn't cut it. Now it's below her bottom. She ties a tail in it about six inches up, from the bottom, so it doesn't fly all over.
Janey the exhibitionist, is gone. She has never teased again. Her wardrobe has changed, the slut is gone too. It's almost like every day she gets up, she thinks, 'How would Missy dress.' Then she dresses like that. Bad boy girl is gone too. When Missy died something fundamentally changed in Janey. I don't know how much motherhood figures into that.
Janey changed.
Mostly I think it's just our deep loss and sadness. I know I've lost my edge in basketball, it's just not there. It's hard to play with the Group anymore, and they know that. It's like they move too fast and run too hard.
They drag me out to play, push me hard, and try to speed me up. To get me past my loss, I go, and try, but they know it's not working. The games are getting further apart. The Group's getting further apart. They all come by the house and see us. Janey, Meli, and I, just one at a time, not as a Group. We don't watch games together either.
If we didn't dislike (hate) her so much. It would be a sad tale of Janey's mother. Broken nose, two black eyes, broken cheek bones, three teeth, four broken ribs, and a punctured lung. Is what Janey did to her. Janey's Dad, David started divorce proceedings right after the funeral, while she was still in the hospital. He was fair to her. But she turned around and gave the house and everything to the church.
They sold it out from under her, said they needed it for their 'building fund', they never built anything. And later there was charges brought of mishandling church funds. I guess one of David's friends is pretty high up in the police force. She gave it willingly, David tried to fight it but couldn't, she had gotten it in the divorce. It was hers to give. No one knows where she is, and we're not looking. Could be homeless.
David couldn't stay in town after the divorce. So I got him on with our company in England. He flies back and forth a lot, to see Meli. That we know of, Janey's Mom has never seen her granddaughter. That's what we ended up calling our daughter, Meli. Melisa Lucciola Giovanni, our firefly.
Second Anniversary of Missy's death, we installed the monument that Janey designed. Three tall spires joined by arches, with all six rings, enfolding the three plots. The spires are exactly half our heights, half mine, half Janey's and in the middle half Missy's. With the appropriate rings on each.
Meli made it passed her terrible two's before she lost her Nonno Giovanni, he was the first to go of her five grandparents. My parents, Missy's parents and David.
Old Man came to visit; he'd lost Mary this year too.
Tom and Alex had a baby boy. They stupidly named him Markus Thomas Miller.
Gray got married, that was a shock. Kathryn, very petite, dark hair, light blue eyes. He might have had a small crush on Missy, least I always thought he did.
Next year we added the wrought iron fence around the plots. Meli was three this year so we decided she needed a sibling before she got too much older. We still have Missy's Gift, and I don't think Janey and I have ever had a serious argument. Spats sure, I'm Italian, we argue for the hell of it, but never anything serious. We seem to agree with each other a lot too, more than other couples. If we're out socializing, dancing, dinner, anything, I don't have to worry about my wife.
If some man causes her trouble, I know it right away. She knows when I'm coming, and I'll be there right away too. Men will always cause trouble. I face it every day, my wife is extraordinarily beautiful. Men will always want her, I really don't blame them, and I want her too. Since Missy died Janey's beauty has changed, it has this ethereal melancholy to it. That's hard for anyone to resist. Even me, every day I grow more in love with her and she with me,I can feel it. Thanks to Missy's Gift.
We could never cheat on each other, the other would know instantly. The other would know if one even wanted too. We don't, I don't think we even could.
Mick married this year, Caroline. You guessed it, very petite,verylight blue eyes, and dark hair.
I guess Missy had an effect on everyone.
Next year, Janey was very pregnant. So I added some shrubbery to the corners of the fencing. In her fifth month, Nana Giovanni moved in with us. Meli loved it, with Nana and the new one coming. I'm looking for a new, bigger home.
I needed to find it more than I knew. Now day's doctors aren't fooled about births very often, but little sister did, they said she was hiding. Matteo Janis Giovanni was eight pounds two ounces. Four minutes later. His fraternal twin was three pounds two ounces. They rushed our Monalisa Bella Giovanni to the Neo-natal unit right away. She looked premature, blind, and with her unusual birth. They're not taking any chances. She's okay, she's perfect, and she's just our tiny baby girl.
This year it's been ten years since Missy's death. We're running out of ideas for our plots. The cemetery people are asking us to quit making improvements. So we'll have to think of another way. Janey and I have been talking, maybe looking into something more positive, to commemorate Missy's day.
We lost Nana this year; the kids took it very hard, even more than I did. It will be a long time before they get over this death. Plus it's the first death they've ever been close too.
I miss our beautiful, porcelain skin, white blue eyed, little doll, Missy. Even ten years after, I see shadows pass over Janey's eyes. I see Missy in them; sometimes I hear/feel her crying at night. Sometimes she hear/feels me, crying at night. We try and comfort each other, all we can. But both of us have always felt that missing part, the piece that makes us not complete. For ten years there has been a hole in our souls and there willalways be.
But I look to our family, and I canalmostfeel whole, Janey too. My wife grows more beautiful every day. Janey's one of those special women who grows more beautiful with motherhood and maturity. It's not just her husband that sees this; I see that green eyed monster jealousy, on faces around her every day. Plus I love her more day by day.Butshe's not my forever love, she knows that. And I'mnother forever love too, and that's OK.
Missy is that forbothof us, thatforever love!
I had it done and it's over the head of our bed, the one we had in the before time. It's huge, a very large painting of a nude, upper chest, head and shoulders of Missy, Our forever love.
Now, our children are everything to us. Everything else is just dross.
Meli, our first born. Special, our firefly, her mother's daughter. She's kept her silver white hair, her forever tan, and her laser green, iridescent eyes. Even at nine you can tell she's going to be exotic, and strikingly beautiful, maybe even more than her Mom. People are already calling, wanting to use her in photos and ads. She's also going to be that special wild child too; you can see it even now. She's also got her mother's intelligence. She's running away from her class mates, scholastically. She's kind, loving, and gentle, until you break through to her temper. I couldn't be more proud of her, of Meli.
Matteo is already going to be a big solid copy of me. I'd like to make a big joke, but I can't. He is what he is. He's already head and shoulders above his year mates. He's not clumsy like other kids his age. His movements are fast, quick, and sure. He's already strong, he's quiet too. But he listens, sometimes when we're helping Meli do homework. He listens, and then answers too. Curly dark Italian hair and skin, flashing blue eyes, but most of all. Matteo is a Mama's boy, he follows her around, watches her, listens to Janey. If you need or want Matteo to do something, Have Janey ask him to, and he'll do it.
In some ways our family is just like us, as we used to be.
Monalisa our baby girl, our youngest by four minutes. She is everything her siblings are, and strangely more. She will be as beautiful as her sister is, just in her own special way. Never any less beautiful, maybe even more, just in her own way. Monalisa is special to us, Janey and I, in special ways. She will have that extra something that pulls people to her. I know, as parents there should be no favorites. And the others will never know, that she is.
In a small way she soothes our souls, Janey's and mine. In another ways...oh it hurts, so.
She's always happiest when she's in one of our laps, or touching either of us. At her age, she can read very well. She'll read to us, or by herself. It's very rare to have a child this young read to themselves. The books she's able to read at her age, it's amazing. She just loves to read. She'll answer Meli's homework questions too, sometimes before either of her siblings. She loves to be clean and with special, nice clothes on. She loves Janey, there's a special bond there. I know it, I know she's a little bit Daddies' girl too. She is just a little bit, in size too. We try not to let her know how much or why, she's so special to us both. We don't think it would be good for her development. Plus it's a little scary too.
You see, she is our; dark haired, porcelain white skin, beautifulwhite blue eyed, tiny baby girl. Lissy and we love her.
Forever.
