*** A DESIRE TO FLY ***
Bailey cried out as her attacker grabbed her by the hair of the head. "Come on bitch," he yelled as he tugged her forward. Reaching up with both hands, she grabbed him by the wrist, attempting to free herself. She could feel the rock hard muscles in his arm tense and tighten as he pulled her behind the building. There, she let out a whimper as she was thrown to the ground.
Sitting upright Bailey crossed her arms across her chest, cupping her exposed breasts with her hands. She didn't dare to look up, keeping her eyes to the ground. She could tell there were now three other men standing around her. Her body shook, not from exposure, but from the sheer terror she was experiencing. This was not what she had planned for. Her uncontrollable cravings for risk and excitement had drove her to more and more dangerous situations. She knew she had a problem, and she had tried to control her odd and perverse desires, but now she was caught and wished for nothing else but to return to her boring and uneventful life.
Without raising her head Bailey shifted her eyes upwards. Looking at their bodies, she could tell by the clothing they wore that these were the boys that had been chasing her earlier. She gazed over at the one that had grabbed her by the hair. She could see an intricate design of tattoos running up both arms of the youth. Prominently displayed in the design on his left arm was a set of hands, pressed together as if they were praying. On his right hand she could see a small tattoo between his thumb and index finger. It was a small five-point star. Slowly gazing around, she noticed that each of the men around her had the same star on their hands.
"Luis," the tattooed boy commanded. "Tell Peanut to bring he car up."
She watched as the one she assumed was Luis quickly turned and ran to the other side of the building. Her mind was in a daze and she felt as though she were watching some sort of movie. She wanted to cry, but no tears came from her eyes. It was as if this was happening to someone else. She wished she could simply sprout wings and fly away.
"I don't know where the slut was going," the tattooed man remarked as he looked at his friends. "Fucking bitch is fast, too." The others laughed as they looked down at their captive. "Hey Slut!" he said as he glared down at her. "What the fuck are you doing out here?"
Bailey trembled but remained silent. She brought her knees up to her chest, trying to shield her exposed body.
"Yo, bitch!" the boy again yelled. "What the fuck are you doing, naked, running through our hood?"
Just then Luis came running around the corner. She noticed he was a slender youth with a pencil mustache, and wore a black headscarf like the one that the tattooed one had lost earlier. "Hey Gino," he said. "Peanut wants to know if you want him to drive around to here."
"What the fuck," The tattooed boy responded as he flailed his arms. "I said bring the car up. That means ... bring the fucking car up." He watched as Luis nodded and again disappeared around the corner. Gino shook his head in disbelief and turned his attention back to the frightened girl. Giving an angry look he slapped Bailey firmly across the top of the head.
Suddenly Bailey found the tears she had been looking for. Her face was hot and flushed, and she could feel her eyes swell and weep down the side of her cheeks. "I ... it ... it was just a game," she said sobbingly. She buried her face between her knees and crossed her arms across the top of her head.
Gino reared back and cocked his head. "Game?" he said with a laugh. "What kind of fucked up game are you playing?" His friends chuckled as Gino began to pace back and forth in front of the girl. "Did you win the game?" he asked with a grin.
"Yo Gino," one of the other boys spoke up calmly. "We need to get out of here. Let's take her over to Robert's." The boy pointed to the other side of the vacant lot. "It's just over there."
Gino nodded. "Yeah. You and Snyper run on over there. We'll bring her over in a few." Bailey watched as two boys turned and ran across the lot, towards one of the homes across the street.
Suddenly, she heard the rumble of the car's exhaust moving closer. As the vehicle's headlights came into view, Bailey brought one hand up to her brow and shielded her eyes. She watched as the back of the building was slowly flooded with bright white illumination, the boy's shadows growing longer and stretching across the lot as the car pulled up and stopped.
"Stand up cunt," Gino commanded. As she rose to her feet he grabbed Bailey by the arm and roughly marched her to the back of the car. He then pounded on the rear of the vehicle a couple of times and yelled for Peanut to open up the trunk. She could see the driver quickly open the door and jump out of the driver's seat. He was a stocky youth with a wide frame. The cap he was wearing was tilted slightly off his head and she could see his short, buzzed hair cut underneath. With keys in hand, Peanut unlocked the trunk and pushed the lid fully open. "Get in," Gino said calmly.
Bailey hesitated, and soon felt Gino's grasp as he clutched the back of her hair. She winced and grimaced as he pulled her close to his face. His head was shaved smooth and he sported a goatee that was trimmed close to his chin. For the first real time she looked into his eyes. They were black and cold, and she could see anger dwelling deep inside him. Giving a stern look, Gino once again commanded, "Get in."
Still sobbing Bailey climbed over the back of the car, into the cramped compartment. She pulled herself into a fetal position as her body quivered in fear. She could smell the sickening odor of the vehicle's exhaust as she watched Gino smile and slowly close the trunk lid shut. As the darkness enveloped her, she found herself bawling uncontrollably. She then remembered Gino's tattoo, the hands pressed together. She began to pray.
*** THE LIFE OF THE PARTY ***
It had only been a few minutes since she had been locked in the trunk, but to Bailey it felt like an eternity. She could feel the car moving and turning as it made its way down the roadway. Her mind raced with morbid thoughts of what might happen to her. "Where are they taking me?" she asked herself. There were so many boys. She had to find a way out.
Her heart raced as she felt the vehicle come to a stop. As the trunk lid opened she shielded her eyes and found herself being forced into the harsh outdoor lights of a stranger's home. Gino grabbed her by the arm and shoved her forward, her naked flesh fully exposed for all the world to see. As he pushed her up the stairs of the front porch she looked at the house, its once white paint chipped and hanging in shreds from the weather boards. The home's windows hadn't been cleaned in years and were so dingy she could barely see through them. Reaching the top of the steps, she glanced at the sad remnants of the screen door that hung in the front doorway. Its aluminum frame was dinged and warped, and the screen was ripped with one corner hanging free. Gino pulled the door open and pushed her inside.
"Where's Robert?" Gino asked as he walked into the living room of the home. The man they called Snyper stood between the entrance of the living room and dining room, across the room from the front door, his black ball cap turned backwards. He rolled his eyes and pointed to his right, at the other side of the living room. There they could see a frail looking man slumped into the comfort of large green sofa at the exterior wall, next to the front door. His eyelids drooped as he raised his arm up to wave, the tourniquet and needle still hanging from his arm. "Aw man," Gino said in disgust. "Somebody pull that shit out of him before that fucker kills himself."
Bailey watched as Luis made his way over to the junky. She then turned and surveyed the room. It was like some throw back from the 1970's, its wood paneled walls and dirty green shag carpet. The home was strewn with clothing and food wrappers, and smelled musty and dirty like the inside of a garbage can. A mismatch of furniture sat haphazardly around the area, a tattered plaid couch sat at a wall across from the green sofa, and a large wooden coffee table was positioned in the middle of the room. At the far end, she could see an old recliner, its cushions ripped and frayed, exposing the yellow foam underneath. Her eyes were then drawn to a picture of Jesus hanging on one wall above the plaid couch. Turning back she could see a poster of a naked woman pinned to the wall just across from it.
Gino walked over to the coffee table and with one swipe of the hand cleared the trash that had been setting on its top. Bailey watched as he shoved a large glass ashtray off the table and into the floor, the ashes, cigarette butts, and remnants of marijuana roaches spilling across the room. "Sit," he ordered as he looked at her with a stern gaze.
Bailey didn't hesitate. Making her way around the rubble, she plopped her butt down on the wooden furniture and again crossed her arms across her breasts. She kept her knees close to her chest and tight together, while looking down at the carpet. She feared what might happen if she made eye contact with any of her captors.
"Where the hell is Rafael?" Gino asked as he looked around house.
Snyper straightened up in the doorway. "He ran over to see if Marco is coming." She watched as he brought a cigarette up to his lips and slowly inhaled, the fiery end of the smoke glowing bright orange. "I think he said he was gonna bring back some beer too."
Bailey could only assume that Rafael was the boy that had left the bar with the one they called Snyper. She wondered to herself how many people were coming to this quickly developing party. She sat stoically, trying not to make a sound. Gazing over at Luis, she saw him finish tending to Robert and ease over to the recliner. There, he sat down, gave a sigh, and pushed the chair back.
"Get the fuck up," Gino ordered, looking over at Luis.
"Shit!" Luis complained while hopping up to his feet. "I never get the good seat."
Gino shook his head as he sat in the chair and relaxed back into the cushions. He then looked over at his prize, shivering and frightened. He looked on as she tried to cover herself, fidgeting and squirming. Her body was scratched and dirty, and her hair was disheveled. Despite her current appearance he could tell she was a beautiful girl. "Man we been chasing this puta all night," he quipped. "Fucking bitch made me lose my do-rag too." He looked over at Bailey. "Show me your arms," he commanded in a loud voice.
Bailey looked over at Gino and timidly extended her arms out in his direction. He leaned forward, looking closely at her forearms and hands. "Bitch ain't no junky," he said looking at the others. "What kinda fucked up game is this cunt playing?" Bailey looked around the room, and watched as Luis and Peanut sat down on the plaid couch behind her. Snyper still stood in the doorway, smiling from ear to ear, and displaying one gold tooth amongst a set of pearly whites. Robert remained motionless on the sofa. Bailey began to feel as though she was a pet on a leash as the men talked about her.
"What kind of game you playing bitch?" Gino asked.
Bailey sat silent, hesitate to move and keeping her eyes down. Her mouth was dry and parched from the running and excitement she had experienced throughout the night. Looking at her body she could tell she was dirty and scratched from her attempts to escape and the rough treatment she had received.
"Bitch!" Gino screamed as he slapped his hands together. "If I have to ask you everything twice, you're gonna piss me off." He took a moment and calmed himself. "Now," he said with a composed tone. "Tell me what you're doing."
Bailey's bottom lip puffed out as she mumbled and tried to find the right words. "It ... it's ... something I do for excitement," she stuttered. She listened as they all snickered under their breath. She could feel them looking up and down her body. There was no need for them to undress her with their eyes. She was experiencing what she had, until that night, avoided, she was caught bare and vulnerable.
Gino looked at Bailey with a puzzled gaze. "You like to run buck ass naked for fun?" he asked.
Bailey nodded and sniffled.
"Well hell," Gino said eagerly as he leaned back in the chair. "If you want excitement, we can give you excitement." He looked around the room as all the others shook their head in agreement. He extended his arms up and rested them behind his head. "I think all of us can give you the excitement you want."
"Gino," Luis said as he stood up. "Dat bitch has got some fucking hot lips, don't she?"
Gino grinned. "Looks like this bitch got a nice everything." He looked at her and again smiled. "Snyper! Put some tunes on." Snyper turned and pushed a button on an old stereo system that was standing on the floor next to him. Suddenly the room filled with music, a Latino song that Bailey did not recognize.
Snyper then walked over to the girl and pulled her to her feet. She flinched and turned to face him as he patted her on the butt. Leaning forward, he whispered, "Been a long time since I tapped a sweet white ass like yours."
A shiver ran up Bailey's spine. "No ... no ... no ... please!" she begged as she fell to her knees. Turning her head in all directions she looked at the men around her. She glanced back at Gino and pleaded, "I can give you money! Please! ... I have a car! You can have it!"
"Awww, that is fucking sad!" Snyper exclaimed. "Do we have to listen to this shit?" Snyper looked over at Gino as he sat grinning from ear to ear. "Come on man, let's fuck this bitch now."
Gino only grinned and shrugged.
That was all the signal Snyper needed as he quickly pulled out of his shirt and began unbuckling his pants.
Snyper's move excited Luis, and he again sprung from the couch, letting out a "Whoooo Hoooo!" He too began shedding his clothing, and tossing them in pile in the corner of the room. Peanut remained seated, his arms up and his fingers interlocked behind his head. Robert remained dazed and confused, still zoned out on the sofa.
Gino pulled off his shirt and again leaned back into the chair. He decided he wanted to watch for a while before he showed her what a good time really was. He licked his lips as he watched Bailey twitch in misery. Her torment excited him, and he could feel his pants begin to bulge.
Snyper now stood in the room completely naked. He was a muscular youth with well-defined arms and legs, and rippled six-pack abs. He had several tattoos displayed across his chest, but one on his arm caught her attention; it depicted a naked woman with a sniper's crosshairs aimed at her chest. Bailey could see his semi-erect cock as it dangled between his legs. It was long and thick, and she imagined the pain she would feel if he made good on his threat to sodomize her. She watched as he slowly made his way behind her, wrapping his arms around her and groping her perk breasts. He smelled of sweat and beer, and she could feel his hot breath on her neck as he leaned forward and licked her under her ear.
Luis was now also naked, accept for the do-rag still covering the top of his head. He was a skinny youth, obviously much younger than the rest of the gang. Bailey looked in horror as his fully erect member stood at attention, ready for action. He moved up close in front of her, snickering and giggling as he looked up and down her body.
Bailey resigned herself to the fact that she was about to be raped. She was going to be taken in ways she had never known, and never desired to know. She trembled as she felt Snyper's wanting penis probe her backside. She could feel it growing harder with every brush against her tingling flesh. Trying in some way to escape the fear she felt, she looked away to the wall where the image of Jesus hung in its frame. It was then that she noticed the horns that had been drawn onto his head with a black ink marker. The realization made her body shudder and she began to bawl.
"Bend her over," Luis said laughingly. "I want those lips around my cock right now."
Snyder pulled Bailey back, and moved her again over to the coffee table. There, he bent her forward, forcing her onto the furniture on her hands and knees. He slapped her ass and ran his hand across her quivering mound. He looked back at Gino, still seated on the chair directly behind them. Reaching down he spread her pink labia open, fully displaying her womanhood to his friend. Giving a nod he moved his hand up and between her firm cheeks.
She could feel Luis' hand as he grabbed her by the hair and forced her head towards him. She was paralyzed with fear and closed her eyes. "This is not happening," she said to herself. "Any moment I'm going to wake up and this will be a bad dream." She tried to think of some other place, a happy time in her life, but each time she was poked and prodded by her assailants, bringing her back to her grim reality. She opened her eyes, but could only see Luis' hard cock as it stood ready to feel her trembling mouth. He pushed it forward, touching the head of his dick to her lips. Though she couldn't see behind her, she could feel Snyper's hands firmly holding her hips, his member now hard as a rock and probing between her ass cheeks.
She turned her head, trying to avoid Luis' invasion. She could see the screen door as in hung in the doorway in shambles. Just through the screen she could make out the lights of Tommy's Bar in the distance. That was where it had all began, and she wished she could be there right now. Looking down she could see the large ashtray that had been tossed to the floor. She felt Luis' hand as it grabbed her chin, turning her head back to his stiff rod. Again, he pressed it to her lips, forcing her to slightly take the tip into her mouth.
*** THE ROUGH FEEL OF LEATHER ***
Suddenly, Bailey mustered a sense of rage. Reaching down, she grabbed the ashtray from the floor and, with a scream, she reared up and swung the heavy object wildly in all directions. A lucky shot quickly caught Snyper in the side of the head. Stunned, the man grabbed at his eye and fell back, stumbling in front of Gino's chair.
Surprised by the move, Luis stumbled back, landing in Robert's lap. In an instant, Bailey had leapt to her feet and darted for the doorway. The feeble entrance was almost ripped from its hinges and the petite girl shoved it open. She felt the door hit something on the other side as she again screamed at the top of her lungs. Pushing on the door again, it swung fully open and fell crooked onto the porch.
As Bailey made her way outside she could see a body doubled over in front of the doorway. It was Rafael, who had obviously been returning from his beer run. She could see a six-pack rolling down the front porch steps, hissing and spewing streams of beer from the punctures in the cans. Rafael stood with both hands up to his face, moaning and groaning in pain. She realized she had hit him in the nose with the door.
Quickly Bailey leapt from the porch, onto the wet grassy lawn. She looked forward, eyeing the lights of the bar across the vacant lot. With every ounce of strength she could gather, she sprinted towards the building. "I have to make it," she thought. "If I can just make it there, maybe someone will help me."
Bailey could hear the commotion behind her as the gang sprang out of the front doorway. They were cussing and screaming as Gino and Peanut quickly ran out after the blonde. Luis and Snyper scrambled inside, looking for their discarded clothing as Rafael collapsed on the porch, still grasping at his nose with blood streaming down his chin. Robert had mumbled and laughed before passing out where he sat.
Huffing and puffing Bailey ran across the street, into the vacant lot. She could see the back of the building drawing closer and closer, and knew she had to make it to the front door of the bar. She didn't care anymore that she was naked, she had to get inside and find someone to help her. She could hear the footsteps behind her, Gino drawing closer. "HELP! ..... Help!" she yelled. "If only someone would call the police," she thought, but she knew the neighbors in this area kept to themselves. She looked over her shoulder. Peanut's bulky legs had given out on him after only a couple of hundred feet, but Gino was hot on her trail with a wild look in his eyes. He was angry and she feared what would happen if he caught her again.
Reaching the back of the building, Bailey ran to the nearest corner and up to the front of the bar. Turning, she then darted for the front door. She could hear Gino, his strides pounding in the gravel behind her. She could see the small light she had stood under as she waited for the cab earlier in the night. She was going to make it.
Bailey reached out, grabbing the metal door handle with one hand, stopping her momentum. She stood upright and pulled at the door handle with all her might. It was then that terror struck at her soul. She pulled again at the door and realized it was locked. She hadn't even noticed the closed sign or that several of the vehicles in the parking lot were now gone. She stood in shock.
Bailey turned around as a shirtless Gino slowed his pace and walked up to her. His muscles were tense and she could see the veins in his arms bulging and pulsing. They were both breathing heavy, but he was able to let a few chuckles find their way from his lips. She could see him looking at her, the delight in his eyes. She could tell she would not survive the night.
Gino again grabbed her by the hair of the head and pulled her to the front right corner of the building. She could see Peanut, lumbering through the lot towards her. She then noticed the headlights pull up behind them, Luis, Snyper and Rafael emerging from inside the vehicle. She wished she could simply die right there. She knew her torment would take forever.
"Where you think you were going you stupid bitch?!" Gino yelled. Grinning he pulled the belt out from around his pants. He then folded it in two, and began snapping the leather together. "Answer me God damn it."
Bailey shook uncontrollably. She fell to her knees and stared upwards, into the stars. It was then that she heard the loud slap. At first she had flinched and braced for the impending pain, but soon realized that Gino was laying face down in the gravel in front of her. She turned to the corner of the building and could see a large figure standing in the shadows. As he drew closer to her she soon realized it was the daunting biker she had encountered when her trek began.
"What the fuck are you pussies doing out this late at night?" the biker asked.
Gino had spun around and pulled himself to his feet. He staggered a second before steadying himself by grabbing hold of Luis' arm. He held his hand up to his mouth and wiped the blood off of his lip. He looked at the towering biker, clad in leather and grinning.
Again the biker spoke, "I asked, why you pussies are out this late?"
Bailey soon realized the gang was hesitant and a bit stunned. On her hands and knees she crawled her way over to the stranger, and wrapped her arms around his leg. She could smell the leather of the chaps he wore, the rough hide cool against her body.
Gino reached back and pulled something out of his back pocket. Holding it up to the side of his head, he pushed a button and in an instant a shimmering blade sprung out and locked in place. "That bitch is ours," he screamed. "And you're a fucking dead man."
The biker laughed and pointed to Bailey. "Her?" he asked. "Hell man, that's my girlfriend." He looked down at the trembling blonde, her eyes timidly looking up to his. "Have they been bothering you baby?"
Bailey looked at the gang, then back to the biker. She nodded and trembled.
"Well, baby," the biker said with a serious tone. "That just pisses me off." The man then reached behind his back and pulled out a large Bowie knife. The thirteen-inch blade glistened in the light as the biker twirled it in his hands.
All but Gino took a step back. Fear showed in their eyes as the hulking figure took a step towards them. Bailey then noticed Luis turn and run to the car, followed soon by Peanut and Rafael. She then observed Gino and Snyper take a few steps back. Looking back she could see the other two bikers she had seen that evening walking out of the bar. As they made their way towards them, she could see one was carrying a baseball bat, with the other displaying a revolver tucked in he front of his pants.
"I'll fucking kill you mother fucker," Gino screamed in a rage. Despite his continuing threats, Bailey watched as Gino and Snyper each took another step back.
The biker smiled. "Prove it pussy."
"AAAAHGGGgggg!!!" Gino cried, as he lurched forward. He jabbed the knife in front of him several times, slashing to the left or to the right. Bailey had quickly crawled to the side of the building to avoid being caught in the fight. As she turned to look back, she saw the biker dodge one strike, then another. The biker then struck Gino hard across the top of his head with the butt of his knife. She could see her one time captor collapse, then grow limp in the gravel beneath him.
Bailey watched as the biker took a few steps back, while Snyper and Luis ran to their fallen leader. Each grabbing an arm, they dragged their friend back to the car, lifting him onto the vehicle's backseat. After flipping the biker off, Snyper slammed the door shut and stepped on the gas pedal. The car's tires squealed and spun, throwing gravel across the parking lot. Bailey watched as the vehicle recklessly barreled down the roadway and faded out of sight.
Bailey collapsed on the ground and began to cry. Her face ached from to all the tears she had shed throughout the evening. She could see the biker as he walked over to her side and knelt down. She wasn't sure if these men were any better than the ones that had just left. She rolled onto her back, sniffling; her arms pulled up over her head. No longer did she try to hide her body. Looking up she gazed at his long hair and beard. She began to shutter as she watched him pull off his heavy leather jacket, revealing the filthy tee shirt underneath. He smelled of grease, and leather and gasoline. She could see the other two bikers walk over to her side, staring down at her.
The biker reached down around Bailey's neck and gently raised her upright. To her amazement she watched as he then wrapped his jacket around her naked torso. It was warm inside and felt good against her body. "Are you OK?" he whispered. Bailey could only cry. He then slipped one arm under her back, the other underneath her legs. Scooping her off the ground he began carrying her, making his way to the front door of the bar.
Inside, he carried her to one of the bar's two pool tables, and gently laid her onto the soft green felt. He looked to his friends. "Hey Meat, get her some water."
One of the other bikers quickly ran behind the bar and grabbed a bottle. Rushing back to the pool table he handed it to the man, who opened it and brought it up to Bailey's pouting lips. She raised up and took a couple of swigs. She then grabbed at the bottle, downing the rest of the contents.
"Get her some more," the biker barked as he looked down at the girl. "My name is Tank," he said with a smile. He pointed to the other men. "That is Tommy, the owner of this place, and that there is Meat."
Tommy raised his hand and smiled. He was a rough looking man with black wavy hair and a full long beard. Meat continued behind the bar, this time emerging with several bottles of water. He had long stringy blonde hair and, even though it was dark outside, he wore a dark set of sunglasses.
"I saw you earlier tonight, didn't I?" Tank asked as he opened another bottle.
Bailey nodded as she took a drink from the second bottle. "You scared me." she said as she gave a timid look. "I thought you were like those other guys."
"Who me?" Tank asked with a laugh. "I'm a teddy bear. Hell, I ain't nothing like those guys. I may be a son-of-a-bitch, but I ain't no evil mother fucker like those punks. Kidnapping a woman, stripping her naked ... shit ... I should have killed all those piss ants."
Bailey kept silent at the remark. She didn't want her new friends to know the truth. She looked at Tank's face. As he smiled she could see the lines gather around his eyes and forehead. She guessed he was in his late forties, but his days of hard living had taken their toll. His skin was leathery and rough. She gazed into his deep blue eyes. Behind them she saw kindness and concern. She had totally misread their teasing earlier in the night.
"I'm Bailey," she said. "What is your name?"
Tank looked puzzled. "I told you, it's Tank."
"No," Bailey said with the first true smile that she had shown all evening. "What is your real name?"
Tank grinned back. "It's just Tank," he answered with a smirk.
Bailey nodded and pulled the leather jacket tighter around her body.
"Let's get you something to wear," Tank said as he looked over at Tommy. "You have anything she can put on in here?"
Tommy looked around. "Uh ... I may have an apron in back. Maybe some paper towels."
Tank looked back at Tommy. "Paper towels? Are you fucking serious?"
"Hell, I don't know Tank," Tommy answered. "It's a bar, man. It ain't no clothing store." Tommy stroked his long beard with one hand. "I could go over to the house and get some things and come back?"
Bailey looked up at Tank. "I'm OK," she said as she looked around the room. The lounge was empty, except for her and the three men. The room was dingy and dark with the only light coming from a few neon beer signs and a large beer cooler. Behind the bar hung a large rebel flag with a Harley symbol displayed at its center. She knew that, during her normal life, this was a place she would never have walked into, but tonight it was her sanctuary, a safe haven from the terror she had felt only a few minutes before.
"Will you three just stay with me?" she asked. "I just want to rest a bit."
"Sure sweetie," Tank replied. "You just lay there and relax."
Bailey didn't know why, but she felt safe with these men. Earlier in the night she was prepared to go running and screaming from the gruff looking bikers, but now she felt comfortable around them. For the first time in hours, she was relaxed. Pulling her legs up, she curled up into a ball and pulled the jacket around her. She didn't know if it was from sheer exhaustion, or her mind shutting down from the events that had just occurred, but she found herself exhausted. Though she tried to fight the urge, after a few minutes she soon felt herself drifting off to sleep.
*** BORN TO BE WILD ***
Bailey slowly came out of the haze of her slumber. For a moment she had thought she was at home, safe under the covers of her bed, but as she slowly came to consciousness she realized she was still laying on the pool table inside the bar. Quickly, she sat upright and looked around the room. At the other end she could see a bright light hanging over a table. There, the three bikers sat, laughing and playing what she assumed was poker. Slowly, she slid her way off of the pool table. The tile floor was cold beneath her feet, and she could smell the residual cigarette smoke of the bar still lingering in the air. Pulling the leather jacket closed she then walked over to the table and took a seat beside Tank.
"How long was I out," she asked while trying to conceal a yawn.
"Oh, about an hour," Tank answered, never taking his eyes off his cards. "How are you feeling?"
Bailey smiled and pulled her feet up into the chair. She then pulled the large jacket around her legs, as she laid her head down on her knees. "I feel safe ... now." She looked at each of the bikers. "Thank you for helping me."
Meat raised the beer bottle in his hand up high, as if he were making a toast, while Tommy smiled and said, "No problem little lady."
Bailey then tugged at Tanks arm. "Can I ask you for one more thing?"
Tank turned and looked at the little blonde with a crooked smile.
"Will you give me a ride home?" Bailey asked while raising an eyebrow.
"Well sure sugar," Tank replied. "But, wouldn't you rather get a cab to take you home?"
Bailey shook her head "No." She looked at the other men. "I want you three escort me home. Will you ... please?"
Tank looked at his cards in revulsion. He tossed them onto the table and smiled as he looked to his friends. "Time for a road trip boys."
Outside, the three men straddled their bikes and kicked at the starter levers. Tank and Meat's bike started right up, but Tommy had to kick several times to get his old cycle to run. The motors were loud and roared across the neighborhood. Tank then reached down behind him and pulled out the rear foot rests. He looked at Bailey. "Don't touch the pipes with your foot," he warned in a crusty voice. "It'll hurt like hell."
Bailey nodded as she grasped the front of the motorcycle jacket she wore. She then slung her leg over the rear fender of the bike and sat down on the small rear seat. The action exposed her bare ass to Meat and Tommy who had positioned their motorcycles just behind. They looked at each other and grinned. As she reached around Tank's waist, she grabbed hold of a belt loop with each hand. "Hold on," Tank said over the rumbling exhaust. The cycle then lurched forward and together the three made their way down the road.
As the bike rumbled up to speed Bailey could feel the vibrations of the motor and the roadway tickle between her legs. Tank had tied his long hair back before mounting the cycle, but the ponytail slung around in front of her face as the wind whisked past them. Hugging him tight, she pushed her head into his back, laying her cheek on the back of his tee shirt. She looked out, watching the buildings and telephone poles pass by in a blur.
Bailey felt the night air flow past her body as they raced from street to street. Despite her best efforts the leather jacket blew up and out behind her, and exposed the bottom half of her naked body. She didn't care. She now felt safe with her new friends and was enjoying the ride.
As they continued to travel Bailey could feel Tank's upper body flinch, then flinch again. She then felt a sting on her hand. Quickly, she pulled her hand to her eyes where she could see the remnants of a large insect on her knuckles. She knew Tank's exposed upper body was shielding her from the pain of the insects that were striking him. "There's no way that tee shirt is helping," she thought.
As they pulled to a stop at a red light, Bailey leaned up to Tank's ear. "Those bugs hurt don't they?" she asked over the sounds of the tailpipes.
"Yeah," Tank answered loudly. "Little shits are out all over the place tonight."
Looking around, Bailey could see no other vehicles at the intersection. It was now into the early hours of the morning and she had seen very few cars as they went down the roadway. Quickly, she jumped off of the back of the bike and stepped up to the side of Tank. She smiled and pulled the jacket off, her bronzed nude skin shimmering in the lights of the traffic signals. "Take it," she said while holding the jacket up to him.
"I'm alright," he said while grinning. He eyed her up and down. "It don't hurt that bad. I can take it."
She cocked her hip to one side and stood looking at him. "Put it on," she said pushing the jacket into his arms.
Tank laughed as he took hold of the jacket. "You are a wild child aren't you? I think I like you sweetie." He slipped the jacket on and zipped it up. Laughing he looked back at Bailey. "Well ... Are you coming?"
Bailey grinned as she jumped back onto the rear of the bike. She could hear a couple of cheers behind her, as Meat and Tommy applauded her daringness. She threw her arms over her head and gave two thumbs up as she looked over her shoulder. She giggled and gave a wink, then turned back to Tank. "Let's go," she said as she again wrapped her arms around his waist.
Again, Bailey felt the bike lurch and move forward down the road. She looked at the back of Tank's jacket, and could now clearly read the words on the embroidered emblem. It was a large skull with a couple of crossed pistons at the bottom. Across the top of the symbol read, "Road Saints." She smiled as she pulled close to Tank and again laid her head against his back.
Bailey could feel the wind whip past her naked body as they rumbled through the city lights. All of her previous adventures had been in stealth, hiding in the shadows trying not to be seen. Now she was fully in the open, daring all to look upon her body. Soon she found herself leaning back, holding on to a chrome rack mounted to the rear fender. The position allowed the front of her body to be exposed, and she felt a rush as the air traveled across her nude body. She tilted her head back and closed her eyes, feeling her hair stream freely behind her. Slowly, she began to feel the sensation she always craved; she reached down to find herself dripping with excitement.
Again, the trio found themselves pulling up to a stoplight, this time at a four-lane intersection. Looking ahead, Bailey could see a car, already stopped and waiting for the light to change. As they approached, Tank opted to pull his bike into the left lane of travel, right beside the car. Inside the vehicle, Bailey could see four young men, all dressed in button-down shirts, and drinking beer. They were laughing and talking amongst each other, with the driver bobbing his head in time with the music that was coming from the car's radio. "They must be college students or friends just out partying," she thought to herself. She giggled under her breath as she guessed Tank's intentions.
At first Bailey could see the young men paying no attention to the scene next to them. Then, she realized that one of the men had noticed her. She gave a little wave and a giggle as she watched all four occupants immediately lean their way to the left side of the car; their eyes wide and their mouths hanging open. They began grinning and laughing as Bailey pulled her legs up and wrapped them around Tank's body.
After a few seconds Tank looked over at the car and gave an evil glare. "Hey!" he yelled. "That's my sister you're looking at!" Immediately the men sat up in their seats and moved their eyes to the front of the car. Bailey looked over her shoulder at Meat and Tommy as they revved their engines behind them. She erupted in laughter as she noticed both of them giving the car the same evil glare.
Bailey was still giggling and chuckling as she noticed the traffic signal turn green. As the three bikes began to move forward, she could see the car remain motionless. They didn't dare to stay next to the bikers and let them travel well down the road before attempting to move. As they pulled away she could hear Tank laughing at what had just happened. "That was some fucking funny shit," he yelled. Bailey pulled her legs tight around him and again leaned back on the bike.
Street after street, Bailey relished the feel of the open road, the wind in her hair, and the thrill of her forbidden ride. She basked in the delights she was experiencing, and felt a sense of sadness as the trio drew closer to her home. She had even thought of giving them a few wrong turns, to make the trip last longer. But, she fought her devious side and as they pulled onto her road, she knew this adventure was coming to an end.
As they pulled up to the front of her house, Bailey jumped off the back of Tank's bike to the sound of clapping. Meat and Tommy were giving a round of applause, having thoroughly enjoyed their road trip and the view they had received along the way. She grinned and took a bow, as she stood naked in her own front yard. The night air had made her nipples taut and erect, and she teased her new fans by licking the tips of her index fingers and drawing tiny circles around her areolas. Each of the men grabbed at their chests and laughed. She giggled and gave them a wink.
Walking over to Tank she smiled as he looked at her. "Thank you Tank," she said with a pouty smile. "I'll see you around sometime."
Tank watched as Bailey turned and started her way towards her front door. He watched her exposed ass as it jiggled as she walked. "Hey!" he yelled over the tailpipe's rumble. "Come here!"
Bailey turned and walked back to the biker, standing to his side.
Tank looked back at Meat and Tommy, then motioned for Bailey to come closer. As she leaned in, he again looked back at his partners, and again back at her. "You know how you asked what my real name was?" he asked in a low voice.
Bailey smiled and nodded.
"If you tell anyone I'll have to kill you," he said jokingly. He then leaned over to her ear and whispered, "It's Elmer."
Bailey stood upright and smiled. Leaning over she gently held her hands up to Tank's cheeks and gave him a firm kiss on the lips. She then turned and made her way to the front door of her home.
Tank sat there for a few seconds watching the naked girl in the faded light of the impending dawn. For the first time in his life, he couldn't come up with anything clever to say. The only word that escaped his lips was, "Damn."
Reaching the front entrance, Bailey turned and watched as the trio revved their engines. All three waved just before tapping into gear, and tearing down the roadway out of site. She stood at the doorway for a few seconds and looked down at her body. This was the first time she had been outside her home in the nude, without hiding behind a bush or tree. Reaching down, she pulled a house key from underneath the floor mat at the doorway.
Moving her hand up to the lock, she paused. Turning, she looked to the horizon. She then eased her way to the front step of the walkway. There she took a deep breath as she sat down. Bailey smiled as she looked around at her middleclass neighborhood. Leaning back she ran her fingers slowly along her bare skin, "I think I'm going to watch the sunrise," she said with a smile.
