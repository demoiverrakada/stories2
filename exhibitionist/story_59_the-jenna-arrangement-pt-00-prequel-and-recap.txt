Author's Forward:
If you haven't yet read the first twelve chapters of The Jenna Arrangement, I highly recommend you do so first before reading this installment. They're all pretty short, if you're new to the series, just FYI.
This "Special Edition" chapter features some prequel events as well as a recap of the story so far, but told from Jenna's point of view. We'll talk more on this afterwards.
ALL CHARACTERS ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER.

Friday 9/12/20
So my first official week as a college student is under my belt. Not too crazy, mostly just orientations so far. My art teacher, Ms. Jenkins, seems pretty nice. I'm hoping to learn a lot from her.
Met my roommates this week of course. It's kinda crazy, going from being an only child living at home with mom to living with three strangers all around my own age.
I don't think it will be too terrible of an adjustment; they all seem very nice, and, so far at least, aren't complete slobs. So that's a good start.
Michelle is the oldest, just turned 21. Leana is 20, and Shiane is 19, like me.
Hopefully we all get along.
They've already invited me to a party tonight. They wanna go "meet some man meat," as Michelle so crudely put it.
I passed. I'm still feeling the sting of Jim dumping me. I mean I suppose it was unrealistic to expect we'd stay together, given we're both attending different schools, but it was the way he did it. He basically admitted he just wanted to play the field and bang other women and not be tied down in a long distance relationship.
Whatever. Good luck to any girl stupid enough to hook up with him. Hope she has fresh batteries in her vibrator, because she'll need it after he's done.
Speaking of vibrators, I'm hoping mine isn't dead, now that I think about it. I have the place to myself while my roomies are out. Why the hell not, I guess.

Tuesday 9/29/20
Start my first shift at the diner tonight. Not a glorious job, and it's gonna be tricky working evenings after classes all day. But they're pretty flexible with the schedule. Money won't be great, but it'll be better than nothing I suppose, especially since getting mom to contribute anything is getting ridiculous. I hate having to beg for my own money.
**************************************
Wednesday 10/07/21
Made a new friend today. Well, we've sorta known each other since school started; she's in my art class. But we only really just started talking today. She complimented my drawing and we started talking about art and influences and we wound up having a lot in common. Wound up having lunch with her.
Trish is a little brash, but not in a mean way. She's also pretty talented. We're going to help each other out on projects and stuff; it'll be nice to have a partner. Her dorm is just around the corner, so hopefully we can hang out often. Not that I don't like my roommates, but they're still more acquaintances than friends, ya know? Michelle is the only one who seems to make any effort to be friendly. I hardly ever even see Leanna or Shiane.
Trish wants to maybe hang out this weekend. Not sure what we'll do but I'm looking forward to it anyway.
************************************
Friday 10/30/31
So I'm alone again tonight. All the girls went to a Halloween party. I was tempted to go, actually. Even Trish went.
But instead I decided to just stay home. Michelle left me some wine, so there's that. I've already had two glasses LOL.
Guess it's time to fire up Old Faithful and see if there's any good porn to watch.
***
I can't believe what I just did.
So I couldn't find any interesting porn to watch, and wound up going on Omegle.
Part of it was sheer boredom; I thought maybe I'd actually find someone interesting to talk to.
It was nothing but a dickfest, of course. But I found myself actually WATCHING guys jerking off! I just thought it was funny at first; when they realized I was an actual live female they'd immediately start begging me to strip for them. I may be drunk, but I'm not THAT drunk! I'd get them all excited, thinking I was gonna watch and flash them, then click off their cams.
Then there was this one guy, an older man. He didn't have his dick out right away, but asked me very nicely if he could show it to me, if I could just stay and watch him.
So I agreed. I wouldn't let him see my face except for my mouth, but he never asked me to show him anything. He just took his already hard dick out and started stroking.
I gotta admit, it was kinda hot. He wasn't all that great looking, and his dick wasn't very big. But he was so nice and respectful, kept telling me how beautiful I was, and kept thanking me for watching him.
I wound up showing him a little cleavage, and when he was about to cum, I leaned in, opened up my mouth and stuck out my tongue. He shot right away at that, spunk everywhere. I even licked my lips like I was tasting it.
He thanked me again and I blew him a kiss, and he was gone.
I wound up watching four other guys, just the nice ones, before I finally clicked off and grabbed my vibrator.
I came several times, thinking about how I helped those guys get off without even having to touch them. Something very empowering about that.
Kinky? Maybe. Weird? Definitely. But it may be my new favorite way to get my kicks, LOL.
***************************************
Saturday 10/31/21
So my roomies decided to continue the Halloween festivities here tonight with another party. Oh joy. I used to LOVE Halloween. I dunno what happened.
I hung out long enough to be sociable, and okay, I've had a few drinks.
But now I'm alone in my room while both Michelle and Shiane are getting pounded by their new boyfriends. Jesus, they're loud.
I suppose it could be hot if I found either of those guys the least bit attractive. But I'm actually thinking more about Michelle. I'm not a lesbian, or even bi-sexual, but if I were ever going to experiment (and isn't your college years the time you're supposed to experiment?) with a woman it'd be her. Or Trish. Probably more so with Trish, I'm at least closer with her.
But no, what am I thinking? Guess it's the wine and sounds of sex echoing around the place.
Maybe I'll go on Omegle for a while. May as well, everyone else is getting off, why not me?
**************************************
Friday 11/13/21
Trish is spending the night; everyone else is out with their boyfriends, so it was just us.
We got into the wine, and smoked some weed Trish brought. She suggested watching some porn, which was fun for a bit. Then I suggested Omegle and wound up confessing what I liked to do to guys there.
She seemed to like the idea, and soon enough we were cock teasing multiple guys in a row.
We got a little carried away; wound up making out and feeling each other up a bit. But it was all in fun. And we kept our clothes on LOL.
It was a little weird, kissing a girl. But like Katy Perry sang, I liked it!
Afterwards, we wound up doing something unexpected. Both of us were pretty horny, and pretty high. Trish pulled her little Pocket Rocket out of her purse, telling me how she always had the best orgasms when she was high and hinting how she wanted to masturbate.
I wound up introducing her to Old Faithful, and next thing you know, we're masturbating side by side on my bed.
It was a little awkward at first, but the more I got into it, the hotter it was. Maybe I have an inner lesbian just waiting to break free. Or maybe I was just REALLY stoned. We didn't touch each other or anything, it was more of just a "I'll do me, you do you" thing.
We both came pretty quick, then threw our clothes back on just in time for my roomies to come home.
Trish is currently passed out next to me; Michelle is currently banging her boyfriend again. I'm not gonna get much sleep tonight I think.
***************************************
Monday 01/04/21
God I'm glad to be back at the dorm! Spending the holidays with mom wound up being torture.
She's got another new boyfriend, and already I hate him. Creep couldn't keep his eyes off of me. Mom was her usual, bitchy self, of course.
I gave her a drawing I did of her and dad from one of their wedding photos. She gave me a Visa gift card for 50 bucks. Merry fucking Christmas.
Anyway, looking forward to seeing Trish again, I've missed her. Maybe she'll come over this week and watch guys on Omegle with me again. I gotta admit that was fun. And hot.
Speaking of; I probably shouldn't stay up too late, but I'm thinking I may need a little personal time before bed. Let's see if I can make a few guys cum.
I wonder if someone can become addicted to cock watching?
**************************************
Sunday 2/21/21
I saw the strangest ad on the campus personals page today. Some guy looking for an "erotic fantasy" with a college girl, willing to pay two hundred dollars cash, yet claiming he doesn't want sex.
As much as I could use the cash, (mom's still being her usual tight ass self about giving me my own trust fund money) I'm sure it's gotta be either a scam or some pervert who'll want me to fuck him.
Still, I'm tempted to answer it. My shifts at the diner have been sporadic at best, and even on a good night I don't make much, and I really need to get those books for art class.
The ad said to email for more details. I guess I can create a burner email account to use just to see, if for no other reason than to satisfy my...curiosity.
*****************************************
Monday 2/22/21
So I answered that ad and got a reply back almost immediately. He claims he just wants to jerk off in front of me. Says I don't have to touch him or get naked or do anything but watch.
I find that all very hard to believe for the money he's offering. Still, if he's legit, it would be the easiest pay I've ever earned. And it's not like I haven't watched guys masturbate for me before. Of course, there's a big difference between teasing guys online on Omegle and actually meeting a total stranger in person. The guy could be any kind of awful sex predator.
He looks pretty normal in the picture he sent me, though. Pretty handsome too, for an older guy. He also kinda reminds me of my dad, which is sorta weird, but not entirely off-putting.
I must be crazy for actually considering this. I need some time to think it over.
***********************************************
Thursday/25/21
I can't believe it, but I actually agreed to meet this guy tomorrow at the coffee house.
I still haven't fully committed to going through with it, but he's at least promised to buy me a meal while we discuss the details. I guess it can't hurt to meet him in a public place, right? And if he turns out to be a total creep, I can just bail.
He really doesn't LOOK like a creep, though. He sent me a second picture, and he's really a decent looking guy. Very normal looking. I know, I know, that doesn't mean anything of course. I'm sure the women Ted Bundy killed thought he looked pretty normal when they first met him.
What the fuck am I doing? Do I need the money this bad? Well, yes. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't at least a little...curious. I've never seen a guy masturbate in person before, just online and in porn. I can't help but wonder if I'll get as turned on from it as I do watching guys on Omegle.
I still often wonder why that gets me so hot. Part of it is the ego boost I suppose, knowing these guys think I'm sexy enough to want to get off to. And the control; I can get them to cum for me without ever even getting naked, let alone having to touch them.
I don't know. Maybe it's just been too long since I've done anything adventurous. Because unless this guy turns out to be a total freak show, I'm seriously considering going through with it.
Guess I'll find out tomorrow.
*******************************************
Friday 2/26/21
I'm an absolute basket case right now, but I want to try and write this all down while it's still fresh.
I went through with it!
I met Tom (guess after what happened I should at least use his name haha) at the coffee house as planned. I'm not sure why exactly, but after talking for a while I just started to feel comfortable with him. So strange how he reminds me of my dad. But he's also really attractive. That's not creepy, is it?
He seemed very, well, NORMAL. He did seem somewhat sad, although he tried to hide it.
I get the feeling he's had a rough time with his past relationships, and again it made me think of how dad was after the divorce. And I think that's what made me agree to it.
I brought him home. Impulsive and dangerous, I know, but I felt safer here than going to his place or some hotel room. And I had my pepper spray, just in case.
It was a little awkward, taking his money. I still felt like a prostitute, even though I wasn't going to actually fuck him.
It wasn't until he started to undress that it became real for me. Up until that moment, it was just a bit of fantasy.
And then he was naked. And I'm just sitting there, staring at an absolutely gorgeous cock.
I thought it would be like on Omegle; I've seen all shapes and sizes there and frankly, a dick is a dick, right?
But seeing Tom's in person, literally growing for me right before my eyes...it was both intimidating and thrilling.
I sat there across from him and watched him jerk off while he looked at me with his beautiful hazel eyes and tried to pretend I was so cool and casual; meanwhile my heart was pounding a mile a minute. And not from fear.
I even gave him my panties! Well, sold them to him actually.
I almost didn't, despite the deal we'd made for an extra hundred. Not because I was losing my nerve, but because I wasn't sure I wanted him to be able to tell how fucking AROUSED I was getting.
That's the scariest part: I truly didn't expect to get that turned on.
It wasn't just his cock, although, truth be told, he has a really nice one.
It was the way he looked at me while he touched himself. He openly admitted to finding me attractive, but he wasn't looking at me like I was just a piece of meat or something. He looked at me like he cared about how I was feeling and what I was thinking. And he went out of his way to make me feel comfortable and relaxed.
He was kind, and respectful, and never attempted anything beyond what we'd agreed upon. It reminded me of that first guy I let jerk off for me on Omegle. Except Tom was live and in person. And had a much nicer dick!
God, I must have sounded silly to him when I started comparing the size of his dick to others like I've had some vast experience with them before and not just a few sticky, unsatisfying fumblings with guys who wound up only using me to get off. I don't know why I said all that shit; I guess maybe I wanted him to think I was more experienced than I am.
My panties were soaked by the time I handed them to him. Which I kinda freaked out about a little; I was petrified he might think I smelled bad. Especially being this close to my period!
He seemed to really enjoy them though, even put them over his face, which was pretty funny.
I almost came myself, watching him cum. I had to struggle not to squirm in my chair.
When he left, I ran back to my room and masturbated furiously, and I couldn't...still can't...get the image of his cum erupting all over himself as his intense eyes looked at me out of my mind.
I wanted to fuck him in that moment. I wanted to go over and lick his hot cum off his cock and stomach. I wanted to pull my skirt up and push his face into my dripping pussy.
And that terrifies me.
I told him we could do it again before he left, I even hinted I might be willing to do it for free, I was that turned on.
What the hell am I thinking???
Am I really considering doing that again? Maybe doing more than just watch?
Why do I want to see this guy masturbate to me again so fucking badly???
I just let a complete stranger get his rocks off in front of me! I let him PAY me to do it! And I wanted...I WANT...MORE.
I don't know what to do.
***********************************************
Saturday 2/27/21
I've deleted his emails, blocked him, and locked myself out of my burner account. That way I can't be tempted again. It was too dangerous, too crazy. I was foolish to do it.
It's not him I don't trust. It's me. I don't trust myself to behave if we get together again.
Better to just forget about it.
***********************************************
Sunday 4/02/21
I dreamt about Tom last night, that guy I had the little "arrangement" with.
I dreamt about him masturbating for me, his thick, beautiful cock throbbing while his gaze lingered on me. Only this time, I was naked too, and fingering myself furiously. I woke up just as he came all over my face.
My panties were soaked. I spent the next hour with my vibrator and some CFNM videos, although none of them were doing it for me and I kept visualizing the dream instead.
I thought about going on Omegle and finding a random guy to jerk off for me, but after having Tom do it in person, it's just not the same now.
I wish I hadn't deleted his contact info. And I feel bad I didn't even tell him why.
But what's done is done I guess.
I wish I had at least taken a picture of his dick, though. Or asked him to email me one.
I wish we could do it one more time. Although I couldn't take his money again, no matter how badly I might need it. It made me feel too much like a hooker. Which I'm not against, no judgment, ya know? But it's not for me.
Although I have been seriously thinking about starting an Only Fans page. Michelle has one, and makes some great money at it. I don't know that I'm brave enough for that though. And yet I was brave (stupid?) enough to bring a stranger home to get naked for me. Go figure.
***********************************************
Wednesday 4/12/21
I've been doing some research on the whole CFNM thing. Apparently it's a much more common fetish than I thought. For women as well as the men.
I know I enjoy the feeling of control I get on Omegle; a feeling I never had with the guys I was involved with.
I can decide who I wanna watch, how long, and how much I want to tease them. And I can stop things at any time if I feel uncomfortable.
I wish I'd had the opportunity to explore that more with Tom. While he was pretty much in control during our...arrangement...I never got the feeling of being out of control. He allowed me the freedom to interact only as much as I was comfortable with. I kinda wonder now what I'd have done if I was a little bolder.
I wonder if he'd let me have complete control. Let me tease him, guide him, direct him, like those guys on Omegle.
I don't want him to just jerk off for me again. I want him to know I like it.
Jesus, I never realized I was this kinky. I'm kinda liking it. Too bad I'll probably never see him again, dammit.
**********************************************
Sunday 5/9/21
Okay, a lot to unpack here!
I met Tom again! Totally out of the blue, he showed up at the diner Friday night!
I literally dropped my order pad when I realized it was him. I thought maybe he'd tracked me down somehow, but from his reaction it seemed he had no idea I'd be there.
He was very cool towards me, playing it casual. Which in a way I was grateful for. I'm glad he didn't try to make a scene while I was working.
Long story short, he wound up giving me a ride home during a freak rain storm. We both got totally soaked, and I wound up inviting him in to dry off and wait out the storm.
We were both so filthy after falling in the mud we had to strip off our clothes right at the door. He was such a gentleman, respectfully looking away while I undressed. Although a little part of me wanted him to peek. I know I did when he was undressing.
I still feel a little bad about giving him nothing but a silly looking pink Snuggie to cover up with while I washed his clothes.
Or at least attempted to wash them. The power went out before they'd finished.
I apologized to him about never responding to his attempts to contact me again and explained why. He took it pretty well and seemed to understand.
We'd both had our showers before we lost power, and although I had plenty of clean clothes of course, I wound up staying naked under my bathrobe. I told myself I was just being comfortable, but I knew he must be thinking about what I was, or wasn't, wearing under it.
Still, he never made a move on me, or even hinted at anything, despite me having teased him a few times.
I found myself wondering about what was under the Snuggie and if he was already hard beneath it and just hiding it well.
I decided I needed to find out. I asked him to pose naked for me so I could practice my sketching. The look on his face was priceless; a mix of shock and excitement.
He actually didn't get a full erection until about halfway through my drawing. Even in the dim candle light I could see his excitement. My pussy was getting so wet as I sketched his beautiful cock. I could barely contain myself, although I played it very casually.
By the time I finished the sketch, I couldn't take it anymore. I gave him permission to jerk off for me again, and wound up masturbating myself while I watched him!
I couldn't believe I was being so brazen. I hid myself in the shadows so he couldn't actually see me...or at least, I was pretty sure he couldn't see me. I kept wondering how much he could see, or if everything I was doing was left only to his imagination. I'm sure he could at least hear how wet I was. And my moaning.
It was such a fucking turn on! I came within minutes. So did he, of course.
I felt a wave of embarrassment after, though. I don't know why we feel guilty about masturbating; repressive society ingrains it in us I guess. Although it wasn't guilt about the act itself so much as doing it so wantonly like that in front of someone still essentially a stranger.
We quickly cleaned up, and I let him spend the night in the spare bedroom.
I was so wound up with a mix of emotions that I couldn't sleep. I was both ashamed and embarrassed by what I had done, and yet incredibly aroused and empowered by it. Arousal won out and I wound up masturbating again, thinking about him watching me, and fell asleep quickly afterwards.
I woke up before him the next morning. The power was back on and I was starting the laundry when he walked out of the bedroom, completely naked and with a massive morning erection.
There was something so erotic about it that I decided I didn't want him to cover up, and I told him he could stay naked as long as he wanted. I was dressed of course, although my outfit was a bit skimpy.
He wound up staying naked throughout breakfast, his cock fluctuating between fully hard and only semi erect. Even semi aroused, his cock looked so tempting. He was trying so hard to be cool and casual about it, but I could tell he desperately wanted some kind of release. His eyes were all over me as he helped me clean up after, and at one point his fully erect cock brushed up against my bare stomach. It was like an electric shock went through me, and my clit was throbbing. He wanted me so badly, and I was getting off on it.
He wound up masturbating for me again, but this time I actively teased and tortured him, getting him to confess his carnal desires while I deliberately teased him with my fully clothed body.
I was reveling in the feeling of control over him, and I was so fucking hot that I didn't even think twice when I decided to let him cum on my face.
I literally had an orgasm right there as his hot spunk splattered all over me. It was an absolute feeling of empowerment to have caused that much desire and pleasure without having laid even a finger on him. I even tasted his spunk, something I'd never done. I was so in the moment I didn't even hesitate. The taste was better than I expected, but it wasn't even about that really. I knew doing it would shock and please him. What I didn't know was how much I got off on it too. I liked being a little cum slut. Maybe I watch too much porn LOL.
I quickly went off and masturbated in the shower, cumming several times.
After his shower, we both got dressed and wound up having a long talk.
Well, I did most of the talking, telling him a lot about my past; my bad experiences with my former boyfriends, and about my dad and what he had to deal with after the divorce, and how he reminded me of my dad and that was part of why I felt drawn to him.
I still don't know exactly what this THING is we have. I'm not looking for a boyfriend, but if I were going to see anyone on a casual basis, it would be him. Despite the age difference, we have a lot in common, and I do find him very attractive; both physically and as a person. He's kind, sweet, funny, caring and most of all, respectful. He's agreed to take things slowly and just roll with things as they happen.
Before he left, we swapped contact info, and I even set him up with Snapchat. He was clueless about it, but figured it out pretty quick.
I miss him already. Just thinking about what's happened the past two days has gotten me so worked up. I don't know just how far I'm actually willing to go with him yet. All I know is that it's been too damn long since I've had any kind of sexual outlet besides porn, Omegle, and Old Faithful.
And he makes me feel good about myself while letting me explore my own little kinks at my own pace without judgment or demands.
I wonder if he's thinking about me right now. I wish he could see me, sitting here on my bed in my tiny little half shirt and boy shorts. I bet he'd get a hard-on again.
I think I'll send him a picture on Snapchat. See what happens.
*********************************************
Tuesday 5/11/21
We made plans for this weekend to go see Jaws at the lake! I'm very excited, yet also nervous.
Not about going out with him in public. I'm beyond being worried about what other people think. It's just been a long time since I've gone on a date. If that's what this is. I can't actually think of a better word for it anyway. Should be a lot of fun. My dad loved that movie, but I was always too afraid to watch it with him. Hopefully it won't freak me out too much.
***********************************************
Wednesday 5/12/21
Tommy stopped by the diner tonight for dinner. It was so sweet how he texted me first to make sure I was okay with it.
I was actually more than okay with it. I've been a bundle of sexual energy ever since our weekend together, and our Snapchat Sunday night (which was fucking hot, BTW) only made it worse.
I honestly don't know what came over me. All he did was show up and eat. I think it was when he slipped and called me "princess," and it got me thinking about the role-play fun we had on Snapchat. It made me feel...tingly.
I managed to sneak away to the bathroom for a few minutes. Not the ideal scenario to take care of my sudden need, granted. But at that point I didn't care. I just needed to cum, badly.
My panties were already soaked, and I started to think how much Tommy would enjoy smelling them. The thought of his nose buried in them made me even hotter.
That's when I decided to take a few naughty pictures for him. And then my hand was in my panties, rubbing myself like a woman possessed. I had to stifle my squeals when I came, not wanting the entire diner to hear me.
I was a gooey mess when I was done, and I made sure to catch every drop of it in my already soaked panties. Then I peeled them off and shoved them in my skirt pocket. I found a bag for them in the kitchen and slipped them to Tommy just before he left. I think it really confused him when I told him it was "dessert." I made him wait til he got home to open the bag.
Work got busy after that, so I didn't have time to check the pictures I'd told him to send me. But I could imagine them; his big, hard cock, all aroused and excited from smelling my sticky wet panties. I had to push those thoughts from my mind to get through the rest of my shift, since I didn't want to be serving customers in an aroused state. Especially since I was no longer wearing panties. I felt so slutty. And it felt amazing.
Tommy texted me, offering me a ride home. I get the feeling he really just wanted to see me again after my little surprise treat, and I almost took him up on it. But I wasn't sure what his expectations were and I didn't want to lead him on; I'm enjoying our fun, but not ready to go too far just yet. I decided the walk would help clear my head.
I was exhausted by the time I got home, but still, I couldn't wait to check out his pictures. And they didn't disappoint.
He sent me several, including pics of him smelling AND tasting them. But the one that truly got me going was the one of his cock posed over my panties like he was imagining fucking me in them.
I texted him to thank him for the pics, then gave myself a quick but satisfying orgasm.
Been a long day, but certainly ended on a high point. I'll sleep well tonight.
***********************************************
Thursday 5/13/21
Trish discovered my little secret relationship by accident. We were talking about the upcoming nude art project for class, and going through my sketches when she spotted the one I did of Tommy. I'd forgotten it was in there.
She grilled me with all kinds of questions: Who was this guy? How did I meet him? And how did he wind up modeling naked for me?
I told her parts of the truth, but not everything, although I was tempted to. She really let me have it about bringing a stranger home, and was more than a little concerned about the age difference.
But she also seemed, well, almost jealous. She kept gushing about the sketch, especially about how hard I'd drawn his dick. Pretty sure she suspects that, at the very least, I didn't leave him with a case of blue balls. We used to joke and kid about all the guys we'd gotten to jack off for us on Omegle, but I also know she got off on it, too.
She wants to come with us to the lake on Saturday. Not sure if she's curious about Tom, or just wants to protect me, or both.
I'll have to call Tommy about it tonight. I hope he won't be upset about it.
**********************************************
Saturday 5/15/21
What an amazing day! I feel like I'm floating right now, I'm so happy.
Our day together at the lake was perfect. Well, almost perfect. There was one asshole who started harassing me about being there with my "grandpa," and when I told him to piss off and tried to get away from him, he grabbed me.
I made him pay for that mistake. I pantsed the little prick. And I do mean LITTLE. The jerk was hung like a raisin, LOL.
It almost got me thrown out of the lake. Luckily some quick thinking by Tommy saved me there. My hero!
Speaking of Tommy: We had a few really intimate moments together at the lake. We wound up kissing, like REALLY kissing, while swimming.
Okay, yeah, we did more than just kiss, too. But can I help it if I turn him on so much he gets a boner even in cold water?
I still can't believe how turned on I got grinding up against his cock in the water. I don't think anyone noticed us, even when I came. But I almost wanted them to.
I felt bad leaving him with such a raging hard-on, and later I tried to give him a handjob during the movie, but he stopped me. I was kinda bummed about it, it would have been fun. But I guess I understand. He was worried about people noticing. Plus I suppose it would have been...messy.
It was the second time I blue balled him though. Although I definitely made it up to him when we got home!
He came out of the shower to find me wearing only a little pink crop top and panties. He must have really liked it, judging by how fast his beautiful cock got hard for me!
I wasn't ready to go all the way just yet, (although I must admit, it's been tempting) but I gave him a really slow, sensual handjob. He's very modest about his size, but, while he's no porn star, he really does have a nice sized cock. I couldn't even fit it in both hands!
I was feeling particularly bold, and decided to finish him off by grinding my pussy over his cock.
His hands felt so fucking good on my body! Especially when he sucked my nipples! I came twice myself. I almost let him finger me; I thought he might try, but he respected my boundaries and instead just put his hand over mine as I rubbed my clit.
Oh, and he almost fingered my ass, well, more like just brushed over it with his fingers. It sent a shock through my body. I've never done any anal stuff, so I didn't realize how sensitive I was there. We may have to explore that area more some time.
We had a really nice chat afterwards, and I found out a little more about what makes him tick. And his past. He's had a rough go of it with past relationships. Which I can certainly relate to. Maybe that's why we seem to gel so well.
He got a bit emotional at the end, even cried a little. It was so sweet.
I was so tempted to ask him to spend the night and just cuddle with him til the sun came up. I probably should have. Next time, maybe.
Hang on, phone call.

That was Trish. I'd promised her earlier I'd coach her for the art project, and she actually just asked if I could convince Tommy to pose nude for us tomorrow!
I honestly can't tell if she's really that worried about her art skills or is just looking for an excuse to see him naked in person.
The strange thing is: I wouldn't mind. Is that weird? Most girls would probably freak out at the idea of their BFF seeing their boyfriend naked. (IS Tommy my boyfriend now? I guess he must be at this point. It's weird to consider, but I can't think of a better word for it.)
But not only am I not upset by the idea...it actually kinda fucking turns me on!
I'll have to call Tommy in the morning, see if I can talk him into it. I'm sure I can. After all, isn't that his fetish? He enjoyed it with me, I'm sure he'd want to do it with Trish, too. Although he may be afraid to admit that to me. Probably think I'd get jealous.
I'm curious about that myself. Right now, thinking about it, I think it could be fun and sexy. But what if I wind up getting upset by it? If he gets an erection around Trish, will I get jealous? Wondering if he wants to fuck her instead of me?
I'll sleep on it and figure it out tomorrow.

Well, I really went and fucked up this time!
Things started out great; I'd convinced Tommy to come over and model nude for Trish and I. We were all having fun with it, too. Trish had been playing it cool, but I think she was enjoying seeing Tommy naked, especially after I teased him into getting a hard-on, as much as I was enjoying showing him off.
And I wound up not feeling jealous at all.
Instead, I was happy and excited for Tommy, knowing he was getting a chance to enjoy being exposed to another woman like that, and I was also happy that Trish really seemed to be into it too. And I found myself really fucking turned on by letting my best friend see my man's sexy naked body and luscious dick.
Then I took it too far. Maybe it was all the wine, I don't know. But that's no excuse.
Michelle texted me, telling me she'd be home in a few minutes. I thought it would be funny, and exciting, for her to walk in on him while he was masturbating, and show my man off to another woman. So I ignored her text and instead encouraged Tommy to keep going. I figured he'd get off on it too, right?
Wow, was I wrong! She was pissed when she walked in! And worse, so was Tommy! He drove off in a rage.
I suppose I can't blame him. If he'd have set me up to have one of his friends walk in while I was naked without my knowledge, I'd be pretty upset too.
I feel fucking terrible about it. I just hope they can both forgive me.
****
Had a talk with Michelle and just got off the phone with Tommy. Things have calmed down and both of them have accepted my apology.
Still, I feel nauseous. I didn't realize how much I enjoy having Tommy in my life until I almost blew it.
I love that we've both been able to open each other up to exploring our desires, and he's always been so caring and patient, even when I've been a total cock tease.
I guess I'm starting to admit to myself that I have a kinky side, and it's been incredible sharing it with him. Plus, on the non sexual end, we just seem to get along and share other common interests, despite the age difference.
I've always found older guys attractive, and Tommy is certainly more mature than all the guys my age. I can't seem to meet even one who isn't a complete douchebag, although, to be honest, I haven't really tried since Jim dumped me last summer.
Is this gonna be just a fling? I can't imagine it being a long term relationship. It would certainly be...complicated.
My mother would have a fit. God, I hope that's not why I'm seeing him, just to spite her. That would be terribly unfair to him.
No, that's not it. I have...feelings for him. Maybe even love him. Not in that "'til death do us part" sense, no, God no! I'm way too young to be thinking about marriage! I have career plans and life goals that certainly don't involve settling down and starting a family.
But I care for him. A lot. I just hope I didn't hurt him with my stupidity.
We both agreed a little space right now will be good, but he's agreed to get together again soon to talk more. I'll at least sleep a bit better now.

The nude art project was today. I think I did really well on it.
It wasn't as weird as I thought it might be. And certainly not erotic AT ALL.
The model was okay looking I guess. Not a bad body. I heard a couple of girls giggle when he disrobed; I guess my "practice" sessions with Tommy made me more ready for it.
But there was no sexual energy like there was with Tommy. And certainly no erection nor cumshots!
The only arousal I got from it was thinking about how I'd rather be sketching Tommy's long, beautiful cock than this guy's shrunken, flaccid one. I had to chase that thought away quickly to focus on my work.
Speaking of Tommy, he texted me earlier, wishing me luck on the project. Gonna give him a quick call to fill him in before I gotta leave for work.
I'm really beginning to hate working at the diner. Not the place itself, or my boss. But it's just becoming exhausting, and the pay isn't all that great.
I'll be quitting for the summer break anyway, I suppose. But I seriously have to find something better to earn money next semester.
Mom still refuses to help me out. You'd think having a new boyfriend would help chill her out, but nope. She's still as uptight as ever. I'm really not looking forward to going home this summer. Especially if he's gonna be around.
I've been thinking more seriously about Only Fans again. I suppose what I need to decide is just how comfortable I am showing off my body to a bunch of strangers for money. And whether I can safely protect my identity. I'll have to talk with Michelle about how she handles it when I get a chance.
Shit, getting late! Gotta go. More on that later.

Quick entry; Tommy is on his way over. We're gonna go out, get some food and talk.
I've missed him this week. And I really wanna make it up to him somehow.
We won't have any privacy here for the time being with Michelle around. I'm seriously considering suggesting going back to his place.
I'm not sure what his mood will be, and I'm frankly a little nervous about seeing him again. I hope he's still not too upset.
Because I'm also horny as fuck, if I'm being honest.
Gonna wear my sexiest bra and panties set. Just in case.

I have just a few minutes while Tommy is in the shower, but I just had to write at least some of this down while the feelings and memories are still fresh.
We just finished making love for the first time! God, I'm giddy.
He was so caring, so generous. So unlike my past experiences. I felt so safe, so protected, so FREE!
I lost track of how many times I came. First from his tongue, (holy fuck he's good at oral; first time I I've been with a guy willing to go down on me and I hit the jackpot!) then he let me get on top and ride his cock to several more. I literally felt like I was flying! And God, the way his cock fills me up! I knew he had a decent length, but really didn't realize how thick he is until I actually sat down on it.
And then when he flipped me over and took control...whew. I gushed even more than when he finger fucked me this morning. (Oh yeah, THAT happened, too. Oh, and I haven't even gotten to what happened last night, or this morning with Trish, or our trip to the mall...busy weekend!)
My other boyfriends only ever hopped on top and pumped away for five minutes before busting a nut. Didn't care about me, or my pleasure, or even my comfort.
Not Tommy. He was the perfect combination of strong and powerful (Jesus, the way he pounded me near the end) and compassionate and tender.
I cried a little after, I was so happy.
And then he told me he loved me!
I was so surprised; I knew he cared about me, but for him to say it...oh, how my heart jumped!
I told him I love him too. And I do.
I hear him getting out of the bathroom now, so I'll end with this:
I don't know what's next for us, or what our future holds. I just know that, in the here and now, I'm HAPPY.

AUTHOR'S AFTERWARDS
The Jenna Arrangement has gotten so much wonderful feedback, and I'm truly appreciative that so many of you really seem to enjoy it.
So I thought it would be fun to celebrate the first twelve chapters by getting into Jenna's head a bit. See things from her perspective. (Don't worry, she gave me permission to publish these excerpts from her diary. 😉 )
Hope you enjoyed reading her thoughts as much as I did.
Technical notes: I had to go back through every chapter to put actual dates and days on the entries. Pretty sure they all line up to match where we are in the timeline: late spring / early summer, just before college breaks. And I'd also established Jenna's birthday (6/24/02) in chapter one, although you probably didn't notice it. It was in her email name.
But, working backwards, it meant chapter one had to start in late February. And in that chapter, I described them walking to Jenna's place on a "beautiful, warm evening."
I've intentionally ignored specifics of exactly WHERE this all takes place; no town or state names etc. So I suppose wherever it takes place, it could have been warm, or perhaps unseasonably warm, in February LOL.
Also; I dated the entries with the year 2020 / 2021. And we all know there's been a pandemic. But this is fiction, and I have no interest in including it here.
As for future chapters: Jenna dropped a bit of a hint about it in her diary.
She's fed up with the diner, and is considering a more...risqué way of making money. A way that could also certainly help her explore her kinky exhibitionist side.
Also, there's some tension with mom and her new boyfriend. We'll see how that comes into play.
Still plenty of stories to tell with Jenna. Maybe even more from her point of view.
Feedback and comments, as always, are encouraged and appreciated.
