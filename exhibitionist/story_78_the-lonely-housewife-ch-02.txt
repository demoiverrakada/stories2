Morgan didn't expect to hear from The Voice that weekend. Then Monday came and went with no ring of the doorbell. Same for Tuesday. Wednesday morning she waited. 9 a.m. came and went with no doorbell tone. She occasionally checked her phone to make sure she hadn't missed a call. She checked her headset to make sure it was working. Her heart sank. She thought maybe The Voice had gotten his thrills at the warehouse and that was the end of it. Then, suddenly, there was someone at the door at 1 p.m. that afternoon.
She stood up straight. Her heart leapt.Could it be?!
She raced to the door. Just as expected, no one was there. But there was a white package with a white bow at her feet. She gleefully grabbed the package and raced inside. Like a child at Christmas, she tore open the box.
YOU DESERVE A BREAK, MORGAN. PUT THIS ON A SOAK UP SOME SUN.
She pulled out the two pieces of material. She was holding a slinky white string bikini in her hand.
She smiled and chuckled.This might be the most discreet thing he's sent me yet!
She looked in the mirror and liked what she saw. The white material against her tan Italian skin was stunning. She grabbed a bottle of sun tan lotion and a book she'd been neglecting and headed to the backyard. There she pulled a lounge chair to the middle of the yard and settled in on her stomach. She untied the string behind her back, took a relaxing breath, and opened her book.
The sun and gentle breeze felt good on her skin. The book felt good for her brain. The ring of the phone startled her. She tapped on the ear piece.
"Hello?"
"Hello, Morgan. Are you enjoying yourself?"
"Very much so!"
"You untied the string on your back. Why did you leave your bottoms on?"
She perked up and looked around.How does he know that?!
"Yes. Well, I...I don't want the neighbors to..."
"Who cares about the neighbors? This is your backyard, Morgan. Why are you letting them dictate what you do in your backyard?"
"But they'll see my..."
"You're butt?"
"Well, that, too. But they'll see, um, you know..."
"Your cunt?"
The bluntness of the word made her flinch. "Well, yes."
"Who gives a shit? Take your bottoms off, Morgan."
"Um, okay."
She untied one side of the bottoms, pulled it out from underneath her, and dropped it to the ground.
"Haven't you been on your back long enough, Morgan?" She gasped.How the fuck..."We don't want you to burn."
"What?! But...but..."
"But what? You're afraid someone will see you? Come on, Morgan. If you're completely honest with yourself, don't you find it a little exciting that someone might see you?"
She thought about it. "Well..."
"I know you better than you know yourself, Morgan. I'm just trying to get you to see it. You're a beautiful woman, Morgan. You should be proud of that body."
He was right. She should be proud of her body. She was beginning to realize that.
"Well, okay."
She hesitantly rolled over. The sun was bright even with her sunglasses. She laid there stiffly.
"Morgan, this is supposed to be relaxing. Breathe. Take a breath."
She took a deep breath, then another.He's right! Fuck 'em!She settled back into the chair.
"Did you enjoy Friday, Morgan?"
A smile creeped across her face. Her body temperature rose just thinking about it. "Yes," she said sheepishly.
"I knew you did. You loved that fat black cock in your cunt, didn't you?"
Her body grew hotter. She could almost feel that monster inside her. "Yes."
"Your pussy's getting wet just thinking about it, isn't it, Morgan?"
"Yes."
"Do you want to touch yourself?"
"A little."
"Just a little? You're not being honest with me or yourself, Morgan."
"I know. I'm sorry." She wanted to stuff her fist into her slit right now.
"Morgan, I'm going to tell you something. I don't want you to freak out, okay?"
Her brow furrowed. "Um, okay."
"No, say it, Morgan. Tell me you're not going to freak out."
"Okay. I won't freak out. I promise."
"Have I steered you wrong yet, Morgan? Have I harmed you?"
"Um, no."
"You're being watched." She lightly gasped. "Take a breath, Morgan. It's okay."
A smile crossed her face. "It's you. Where are you?"
The Voice laughed. "No, Morgan, it's not me. Don't look. You'll scare him away. We don't want that." He paused. "It's your neighbor, old man Atkins."
She gasped again. Behind her sunglasses, she cracked one eye. There he was, in the second floor window mostly hidden behind a curtain, looking directly down at her.
"He watches you whenever you're outside. When you hang laundry. When you give your husband a blow job." She lightly gasped again. "He thinks you're sexy as fuck, Morgan. He's no different than any other man. Surely you've noticed the glances. Men find you beautiful. Sexy. They desire you. They want to fuck you. Every single one of them."
Her lip curled at the corner. "What about you?" Her body went right back to needing a scratch itched.
The Voice paused. "What do you think?"
Her mind went to somewhere she had forgotten existed. "I think you want to fuck me. I'll bet you've got a huge cock."
"Why don't you put on a show for Atkins while you tell me what you think I'd do?"
He didn't have to ask twice. She squeaked when her finger brushed across her raised knot.
"I think you want to fuck me. I think you want to fuck me in the middle of the street. Mmmmmmm..."
"Go on."
"But...but first I think you want me to deep throat you. I think you want me to swallow your whole fat cock."
"I don't think you can."
She giggled. "I've been practicing."
"I know you have been."
"Then, after I've done that, I think you'll take me somewhere public. Mmmmmmm..." She began to paw at her breasts. "Do...do you want me...mmmmm...do you want me to be completely naked. Ah!" she yipped when a finger parted her lips.
"What do think?"
"Hmmmmm. I...I think you...you want me to have something slinky on. Oh!" she yipped when she pinched an erect nipple. "I think you want to...to fuck me...while...while people watch but...but don't know you're fucking me. Mmmmmm... Am I...am I right?"
"Go on."
She was squirming in the chair. "I think you'd fuck me with your big fat cock until I came in front of all those people. But...but you...you wouldn't be...mmmmmm...be done yet."
"Oh?"
She shook her head. "Uh huh. Then...then you'd...you'd...ohmagawd...you'd fuck my ass with that big cock."
"Are you tight?"
"Ohhhhhh...mmmmmm...I've got a...a tight little...mmmmm...ass. But...but you'd probably stretch it all out."
"And you'd love it."
"I would!"
"You love a fat cock in your ass, don't you, Morgan?"
"Ohmagawd, I do!"
"Do you think I'd cum in your ass?"
"No. No. I...I think...ohmagawd...I think you'd...mmmmmm...you'd make me...ohmagawd! I think you'd make me...grrrrrrrr...make me get on my knees and...and...cum all over my f-f-f-face." She was squirming on the chair like a snake in the grass.
"Would I allow you to cum, Morgan?"
She was drumming a steady beat on her angry beat. "Yes! Yes. You'd...you'd make me...me cum...mmmmmmm. You'd tell me to...to spread my...my....grrrrrrr. my legs so all those people could see my...my...mmmmmmm...pussy."
"And what would they see?"
"They...they'd see...how wet it was. How...how swollen it was."
"Then what?"
"I think you would...would let them...them...ohmygawd...them fuck me." Her heart was about to pound out of her chest.
"How many of them?"
"All of them!"
"Would each one of them make you cum, Morgan?"
"Yes!"
"Are you about to cum just thinking about it?"
"Ohmagawd, yes!"
"Show me."
Two fingers were pumping her gash. A thumb was rubbing her buzzer while she molested her breasts with the other hand.
"Ohmagawd, yes. Yes. Ohmagawd, yes," she moaned. She began to buck. Her stabs grew harder. Her back arched off of the chair. "Ohmagawd! Ohmagawd, yes! Yes! Yes! Ohmagawd, yes! Ohmagawd! Ohmagawd! Yes! Yes! Fuck me! Fuck me! Yes! Yes! Guh! Guh! Nnnnnngggghhhh aaaaiiiiiyyyyyeeeee!"
She howled into the bright sunshine while man after man had their way with her in her spinning mind. She poked and pawed herself for what seemed like hours until she finally sank back into the lounge chair. Her hands fell away and her ample chest heaved.
"That was impressive, Morgan. You're progressing faster than I anticipated you would. I had no idea you were ready for a gangbang already."
Her eyes flew open. "Wait! No! That...that...no! I'm not! I mean, I don't!"
The Voice laughed. "Calm down, Morgan. I have no intention of leading you into a gangbang."Yet!"Remember, everything from this point on is strictly your choice. You control what you do and don't do. Okay?"
"O-o-okay," she stammered hesitantly.
"However, Mr. Atkins is still in that window probably with some unfinished business." Her heart skipped a beat. She'd forgotten all about the old man looking down upon her writhing body. "Why don't you invite him down? Maybe get to know your neighbor a little better."
"What? No!"
"Come on, Morgan. I notice you didn't even bother to try and cover yourself when I mentioned he was still there."
"What?! I...I..." It was true. She hadn't given it a second thought.
"So don't bother now." He paused. "Go on. Invite him down."
"But...but why?"
"Don't you want to see how excited you make men up close and personal?"
"Well, I..."
"I'll bet he's got a huge hard on right now. Don't you want to see how hard you make men?"
"Well...I..." The thought intrigued her.
"Have I steered you wrong yet, Morgan? Go ahead. What's it going to hurt?"
It was true. This voice had done nothing but introduce new pleasures to her life. Her lip curled at the corner. She lowered her glasses and stared at the man in the window. His jaw dropped and he froze. He knew he was busted. She raised her hand and wiggled a finger at him indicating she wanted him to come see her. He pointed at his chest as if to say, "Who? Me?" She nodded her head and wiggled her finger again. The old man felt like he was getting called to the principal's office. He didn't know if she was going to yell at him or bitch slap him or what. But he decided to face the music, whatever it was.
The gate between the two houses slowly creaked open. Atkins was surprised to see her sitting up right on the lounge chair still naked and facing him.
"Hello, Mr. Atkins," she said nervously but with a smile. "Please, come in."
"Uh...uh...I'm...I'm so sorry. I was just, you know, walking past the window when..."
"It's okay, Mr. Atkins. I'm not mad. Please, come nearer."
His mind began to ease when he realized he wasn't facing a firing squad. But he was still uncomfortable. He wasn't sure what she had in store for him. He walked closer until he was standing only a couple feet away. She could see the bulge in his shorts.
"He watches you all the time," said the voice in her ear.
"Do you watch me often, Mr. Atkins?"
He fidgeted. "Well, I..."
"It's okay. I don't mind."
"You don't?"
She giggled.I guess I don't after all!"No, I don't." She paused. "Do you find me attractive? Is that why?"
"Oh my God yes!" Atkins realized he said that a little too quickly. "Er, I mean, yes. I think you're a, uh, very beautiful woman."
"I'll bet he was jerking off up there," surmised The Voice.
"Were you, um, uh, masturbating up there in the window?"
His eyebrows flew up his forehead. "What?! Well, I, uh..."
"Can you tell if he still has a hard on?" She nodded. The Voice laughed. "I'll bet he didn't cum! You came before he could!"
"Did you...did you...finish?" she asked sheepishly.
"Finish?"
"Morgan, we really need to work on your language. Cum, not finish, cum."
She batted her eyes at the bluntness. "Yes, you know. Did you, um, cum while you were masturbating?"
The question momentarily took Atkins' breath away. "Well, I, uh..."
"Did you? Did you cum? It's okay."
He bowed his head. "No."
"I'll bet he was close!" said The Voice.
"Were you...close?"
"Close? To cumming you mean?" She nodded at him with wide eyes. "Um, yeah, actually. I wasreallyclose."
"Have him show you how close," The Voice suggested.
She furrowed her brow. "Huh?"
Atkins thought she was talking to him. "Yeah. Close. Like,reallyclose."
"Tell him to pull out his cock and show you."
"O-o-okay," she stammered.
Atkins was confused. "Okay what?"
"Oh! I'm sorry. Okay, um...pull...pull it out. Show me."
Is she asking me what I think she is?!"Show you...what?"
"Hiscock! Have him show you hiscock!"
"Your...your, um, cock."
"That's it!"
"You...you want me to show you my..."
"Your cock. Yes. Pull it out. I want to see your cock." She was already becoming more comfortable using the word in conversation.
"Um, okay."
She found herself becoming aroused at the thought of this man showing her his tool. He hesitantly lowered his shorts. Then, suddenly, it sprang out.
It certainly wasn't the most impressive tool she'd ever seen, but it was still better than her husband's. The tip was shiny and the veins were bulging.
"Ooooo, look at you," she whirred. He shivered when she wrapped her long thin fingers around it. "Such a big thick cock. Mmmmmm, your wife's a lucky girl."
"Really? You think?" he asked in amazement as he watched her stroke it.
She nodded. "Mmmmhmmm, absolutely. So, you got all thick and hard like this just watching me?"
"Well, um, yeah, I guess."
She looked up at him with a crooked smile. "You guess?"
"No! I mean, yes. I mean, um, yes, I got like this, um, you know, watching you. I always do."
"Really? Always?"
He nodded. "Oh yeah. Every time."
"But you didn't fin...cum this time?"
He shook his head. "No, not this time. I was really close though."
"Mmmmm, I can tell. Would you like for me to help you fin...cum?"
His jaw dropped. "Seriously?!"
She nodded and smiled. "Mmmmhmmm." She pulled him closer and she scooted forward. She could already feel him throbbing harder in her hand. "Maybe you would like to put it between my tits?"
Atkins practically shouted, "Seriously?!" Morgan giggled and held a finger to her lips. "Oh. Yeah. Right. Sorry."
"It's okay. So, I'll take that as a yes."
Atkins nodded. "Yes, please!"
She giggled and pulled him closer. She felt her heat when she placed him into her cleavage. He disappeared when she wrapped her mounds around his pole tight. She looked up into his twisted face and began to rise and fall.
"Does that feel good, Mr. Atkins." She could feel him throbbing.
He didn't open his eyes. "Ohmagowd, yes," he groaned.
"Your big fat cock feels incredible between my tits," she whirred. "Your throbbing cock is beating against my chest. Are you close to cumming, Mr. Atkins?"
He clenched his teeth. "Yes!"
"Mmmmm, I thought so. Why don't you give it to me? I want it. I want it all over...OH!"
"Gahfuck!"
A thick rope shot out and splashed across her throat. She pressed harder. Two more spurts squirted across her chest.
"Ooooooo, yeah! That's it! Shoot it all over my tits!"
His body shuddered. "Guh! Guh! Huhguh!" he grunted.
The throbbing between her globes finally slowed and the spurts ceased. She pulled back, gripped his pole, and gave it several long, slow tugs, coaxing the last drops out of his vein.
"Holy fuck," he panted.
She licked the droplets off of her wrist. "Wow! That was a lot of stuff!" she said as she looked down at her chest.
For the first time, he looked down. "Yeah, geez. Sorry about that. I haven't cum like that in years."
"It's exactly what I wanted!" She smiled. "I'll take that as a compliment."
"You should. That was amazing."
"I'm glad you liked it." Even with her strokes he was beginning to soften in her hand. She was feeling randy. "Do you think you can, you know, get hard again?"
"Oh geez, I don't know. I haven't, you know, gotten hard twice in years," he said, slightly embarrassed.
"Not even for me?" she asked playfully.
"Well, uh, you know..."
Extremely randy. "Because I was really hoping you would fuck my ass with your big fat cock." She felt him twitch in her hand.
His jaw dropped. "Do what?! Seriously?!"
She couldn't remember the last time she had invited a man to invade her back door, it was usually forced upon her. And she was still feeling a little guilty about recently having someone else in her pussy other than her husband.
She nodded. "Mmmmmhmmmm. I love having a big fat cock in my ass." He twitched in her hand more.
"Wow! I...I...uh...you know..."
"You've never had anal sex before, Mr. Atkins?"
"Well, uh, no. And Edith never lets me go anywhere near that, you know, hole."
Looked up at him with a twinkle in her eye. "I love it," she purred.
"I...I...I don't know if, you know, if I..."
"If you can get hard again?" He looked sad and nodded his head. "Maybe this will help."
"Uhguh!" he croaked when she took him into her mouth. "Ohmygawd," he groaned when she began to suck on his mast.
Much to both of theirs surprise, it wasn't long before she felt him begin to swell in her mouth. She began to move her head back and forth.
"Ohmagawd," he moaned. "Holy shit."
She pulled back and released him with a "pop", then quickly began to stroke his stiff rod.
"Look at you," she said with pleasure. She looked into his face with a crooked grin. "It looks like you're more ready to fuck my ass than you thought."
He looked down at his fresh hard on in shock. "I don't believe it. I...I haven't done that in years."
"Mmmmm. Let's put this to good use." She released him from her grip and spun around. She bent at the waist placing one knee on the lounge chair, a foot on the soft grass, and supported herself with both hands. She looked over her shoulder with smokey eyes. "Ready, big boy?"
"Uh...uh...yes. Absolutely!" He moved in closer while he held himself steady and looked down at her winking backside. "Are you...are you sure?"
She nodded her head. "Mmmmmhmmmm," she purred.
He placed a hand on her hip and moved forward. He paused when he touched her rosebud. Her body quivered in anticipation. He leaned in. He grunted and she squeaked when his tip disappeared. They moaned in unison as he slowly slid past her sphincter until his balls stopped him.
"Sweet Jesus! It...it...it's so tight!"
She was quite accustomed to having a man's poker in her ass, but he didn't need to know that.
"That's because you're so big, sweety," she whirred. "Now I want you to stretch it all out. I want you to give me a good hard fuck."
"I...I'm not hurting you?"
She shook her head. "Not in the least. You feel amazing!"
"O-o-okay," he said with hesitation. "Here it goes."
He placed both hands on her hips. He slowly rocked his hips. "Ohmagawd," he groaned. "I can't believe how tight that is! Are you...are you sure I'm not hurting you?"
Once again, she shook her head. "MmmmmMmmmm. Come on, baby, give it to me. I want it. Fuck my ass good and hard."
"Um, o-o-okay." He picked up the pace. Sweat was already streaking down his face. "How's that?"
"Mmmmmm, better. Come on, baby, give it to me. Fuck it like you own it!"
"O-o-okay."
He began to thrust his hips harder than he had in his life.
"Yes, baby, that's it!" She slipped a hand between her legs. She squealed at the first touch of her angry bean. "Ohmagawd, yes! That's it! Fuck, yes!"
Sweat was rolling off his face onto her toned ass. His face was beet red. "Holy mother Mary! I...I don't know...how much...longer...I can...last!"
"Oh, baby! Are you about to cum?"
"Yes!"
"Oh, baby, just a little longer! I love the feeling of your big cock fucking my ass! Just...just....mmmmm...just a little longer!"
He gritted his teeth and closed his eyes. His fingers dug into her hips. Her muscles were convulsing around his tool. She felt him throbbing deep inside her. Her knot was vibrating under her fingers.
"Ready, baby? Ready? Let's...let's cummmmm...together? Okay?"
He nodded. "Yes!"
She pushed back into his thrusts. "Ohmagawd, yes. Yes! Ohmagawd, yes! Yes! Fuck me! Fuck my ass hard! Yes! Yes! Guh! Guh! Nnnnnngggghhhh aaaaiiiiiyyyyyeeeee!"
She clamped down on his wood he thought she might pinch it off in her ass. Which only made his lift off more exhilarating.
"Mother Mary and Joseph! Oh God! Oh God! Gonna...gonna...guhfuck!"
He was throbbing so hard she thought his cock might literally explode inside of her.
"Yes! That's it, baby! Give it to me! I want it! Give it all to me!"
"Sweet Jesus! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Ohmagawd, yes!"
The old man finally ran out of juice. His weight fell against her.
"Jesus fucking Christ," he huffed.
Morgan giggled. "Did you like that?"
"That...that...that was amazing!"
She giggled again. "I'm glad you liked it. Gah!" she croaked when he backed away and fell out of her gaped hole.
He stepped back on wobbly legs and pulled his shorts back up. "Um, thank you. That...you were amazing."
Morgan fell onto the lounge chair and flipped over, giving the old man a full frontal. "You weren't so bad yourself."
The old man blushed. "Thanks." He paused. "Well, I should probably go before Edith thinks I fell in." He started to turn away, then stopped when she called him.
"Mr. Atkins..."
"Yes?"
"Not a word of this to anyone."
"Oh! Absolutely not!"
"Anyone," she emphasized.
"Got it. Not a word to anyone." He made motion as if he were locking his mouth with a key, then tossed it aside.
Morgan smiled. "Good. Be a good boy and maybe we'll do it again."
His eyebrows shot up his forehead. "Really?!"
She gave him a sly smile. "Maybe."
"Okay. Well, goodbye."
"Goodbye, Mr. Atkins," she said softly, then leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes.
At least, until the voice in her ear startled her.
"Very good. Well done, Morgan."
She gasped. "You were listening that entire time?!"
"Of course I was. That was quite the performance."
"Yes. Well..."
"You just changed that old man's life. He'll never be the same."
She giggled at the thought. "Probably not."
"I almost feel sorry for his wife."
Morgan laughed. "Oh, that poor woman!"
"You did well today. You exceeded my expectations."
"Gee, thanks."What were his expectations?!
"Get some rest, Morgan. You've earned it."
"Wait! That's it? Will I...will I hear from you again?"
"Do you want to hear from me again?"
"Well...I...I..."
"I told you, everything is your choice, Morgan. I'm not making you do anything you don't want to. So, do you want to hear from me again."
"Yes," she said in a hushed tone.
"Get some rest, Morgan."
The line went dead.
"Wait! When?!" No response. "Dammit!"
She took a deep breath and closed her eyes. She relived the day's events in her mind. She wondered how long it would be before she heard from The Voice again. She wondered what he might have planned for her next time. Her body heat began to rise just thinking about it.
Her lips curled at the corner.I hope I hear from him soon.
