Brent: A Beautiful Beau
"She's not coming," I said to myself as I stared out of the 10th floor window. It was a nice view, at least. My reflection mocked me in the glass. I'd rented a suit for this, double-breasted, all blue, my tie red. I had to buy the white shirt myself though. I'd even gotten a haircut and a shave. This whole night had set me back quite a bit, but I'd resisted the temptation to spend even a cent of the $10,000 I'd "earned."
Admittedly, I should've been home now, taking care of my grandmother and my dog, not standing around a hotel room waiting for a woman who would never come. The champagne was probably warm. The quiet classical music I'd set to play had even looped.
I put an arm on the window and leaned against it. Maybe the glass would break and I'd fall. Not suicide, just a tragic accident. That would spare me the heartbreak that was waiting for me at the end of the night, when she never came. It was one thing for me to wait at a fountain and never know if she'd show, but for her to set the time and place and still stand me up, my self-esteem was shattered.
I checked the clock. It was already 8:00 p.m. She knew the time was 7:00 p.m. She wasn't coming. I was a fool, a complete--the door opened. The lights were low in the room, the dimmers down. But the hallway was bright with florescent light, and when that door opened, she looked like a glowing angel.
She came. She really came. I couldn't believe it, but she was here, and she was drop-dead gorgeous, dressed in a red top and skirt, with amazingly sexy stockings and high heels. This was happening. This was really happening. I said a prayer of thanks that the window hadn't broken. I pulled my mask down as I stepped out of the shadows.
"Ginny?"
Her eyes scanned the room and found me, those gorgeous green eyes. Her strawberry-kissed hair fell over them. She brushed it behind her ear.
"Hi."
"You came," I said, still disbelieving.
"I did," she said, stepping in and closing the door, the darkness swallowing her up. "It's so dark in here," she said, giving a nervous little laugh.
"I thought maybe you'd prefer that."
"Yes, I think I do."
"You look amazing, absolutely beautiful."
"I can't believe you're talking," she said. "It's bizarre, and that mask. Is it the same one?"
"Yes."
"You're real, huh?" she said.
"I'm real."
"I don't think I connected the voice to the person until now," she said.
"And now that you have?" I said.
"You look really good," she said. "Like, amazing. I love your suit."
"Thank you. Your... everything is perfect, you're perfect."
She smiled and laughed a little. "I honestly had no idea what to wear."
"I like it," I said. We were still so far apart, me near the window, her inches from the door. I had to get us closer. "Do you want to sit, talk for a while? I have champagne."
"Yes, I'd like that, to sit, I mean. I don't want to drink."
"Are you sure?" I asked, ready to pour.
"I don't want to get foggy, you know? I want to be sober."
I put the bottle back. "Okay, me too."
She approached slowly and then sat on the sofa. I sat down too, with an entire cushion between us.
"I like the music," she said nervously. "I've always found classical romantic."
"Me too," I said.
"I'm sorry I'm late," she said. "I was really struggling to come."
"Why?" I asked.
"Oh, come on, we both know what's going to happen."
"It doesn't have to, Ginny," I said. "We can talk, just spend the evening together, watch a movie." I shrugged. "Cuddle."
She smiled at me. "You know, I so badly wanted to remove your mask during my ceremony, and now that I can, I'm absolutely terrified of what you look like underneath."
"Why?" I was perplexed. I expected to take the mask off immediately and reveal my barista identity, which would certainly give us plenty to talk about.
"Because if I know who you are, I can't keep you bottled up in this room, in my fantasies, in the shadows. And I really need to keep you in the shadows, you know?"
"I'm your dark secret, huh?" I said. It was hard admitting that, but this is what kept us apart, and overcoming this secret and stepping into the light would be a monumental task for her.
"Yes, exactly. I like not knowing who you are. It's like when the villain captures the hero, they never unmask them, because it would ruin the fun."
I smirked. "Am I the hero?"
"Yes. And that means I'm the villain."
"You? Never."
"I think I am," she said. "There's a lot I should tell you, things that would probably make you angry with me."
"Then don't tell them to me, not tonight."
She tilted her head. "Are you so trusting?"
"Ginny, I've waited so long for you, at that fountain, on the phone, in my heart. Yes, I trust you, and my trust has been rewarded. I've missed you more than you will ever know."
"Oh, God," she said, putting a hand on her face.
"What?" I said.
"The way you speak to me... I don't think I've ever heard a man speak to me like that."
I was really confused. "What do you mean?"
"You're so vulnerable. You just say how you feel."
"You don't like it?" I asked.
"I'm not used to it. I didn't like hearing what you said the other night."
"The thing you told me never to say again?" I said.
"Yes, that. And I meant it."
"I understand," I said.
She took a deep breath. "This has to be about sex, okay? We can't get tangled up with each other, emotionally, I mean."
"You don't think it's too late for that?" I asked.
"It can't be too late for that, Beau. Everything I said I meant. This is one time, the last time. This is our goodbye. It was amazing before, and I hope it's amazing again, but we can't, you know..."
"Fall in love?"
"Yes, God, don't put it into words so much."
"You said it."
"You said it," she corrected. "I'm trying not to say it."
"So, if this is just about sex, is that what you want, to get into bed and start?"
She swallowed and stared at me. "Not yet, I need a little time to warm up to you."
"Do you want to use condoms tonight?" I asked.
"No. Do you?" she asked.
"No. I want to feel everything."
"I want that too," she said. "I don't want anything between us."
"So, maybe you do want more than sex?" I said gently. "You want warmth? You want affection? You want connection?"
She lowered her head, giving a small nod. "Yes, I guess."
"Then we'll have more than sex. We'll make love tonight."
"Beau..."
I scooted closer to her on the sofa, my knee bumping into hers. My left hand reached out and took hers. With my other hand, I lifted her chin to see her pretty face. "Just tonight. It will be our little secret, and in the morning, we can say goodbye."
"In the morning?"
"Yes. "
"I don't know if that's a good idea, staying all night."
"It's a very good idea," I said. "We can rest, wake, and make love as many times as we want."
"But we'll have to say goodbye eventually, and then we'll never see each other again."
"Then we'd better make tonight count," I said, and my lips touched hers.
She kissed me back, devouring my mouth like a starving woman, her lips hungrily opening and closing on mine, her tongue inviting me with a flick against my mouth. I met her tongue, and they rolled together while we kissed. Her arms greedily scooped up my head, and mine wrapped around her back. My fingers ran up and down her spine as I kissed her, and she moaned into my mouth.
"God, that, right there," she said breathlessly. "I've wanted that so much, your hands, the way they move when you kiss me. It's like you're kissing my whole body. How do you do that?"
"I don't know," I said. "I love the way you give yourself to me."
"More," she said simply. "More."
We kissed, and my hands once again caressed her back as our lips locked. Her fingers were in my hair. My fingers were gripping her body, feeling the contours of her rib cage. We fed on each other, devouring one another's lips, starving for more. We both broke to breathe, panting, keeping our noses together, the mask between us.
"You smell amazing," I said. "This perfume drove me wild during your ceremony, and haunted me afterward."
"I want to suck your cock," she said.
"You do?"
"Yes. I need to see it again," she said, looking into my eyes. "I need to feel it in my mouth. Touch it. Smell it. I've been so obsessed thinking about it."
"If I let you suck my cock, you have to let me eat your pussy afterward. Deal?"
"Oh, my God, hell yes. I would have begged."
"Do you want to do everything we did last time?"
"And more, I hope." She kissed me again, and our hands hungrily grabbed at each other. I cupped her breasts atop her clothes, feeling their soft shape in the palm of my hand. She eagerly pulled my blazer off and then unbuttoned my white shirt. I remembered she liked this, but she was going so much faster this time. I let her have her way. We had all night to slow down, but we were both craving too much now.
With my shirt open, she hungrily kissed my bare chest. I leaned back into the sofa as her hands pulled and tugged at my clothes. I was out of my white shirt a moment later, and it was thrown across the room. My red tie was torn off over my head. It caught the mask, nearly revealing me, but I pulled it back down.
"Careful," I said, dangling my necktie from my finger. "You don't want to see too much."
I slipped the tie over her head and tightened it over her eyes, blinding her. She stretched toward me, her nose coming closer, looking for my lips. I grasped the tie to control her head and brought her lips to mine. She nipped at my lip and giggled. "You're a yummy little taste test. Let's see how the rest of you tastes."
She went back to kissing my chest, but then she went down on her knees, between my legs, her hands searching and finding my belt, tugging at it, opening it up. I lifted my butt and together we pulled my pants down. Her hands found my thighs, moving across my underwear. I'd worn blue boxers to match my suit, not that she could see them at the moment. I'd been told not to wear anything last time.
She said, "Stand up, please?"
Once I was on my feet, she helped take off my shoes and socks and pull my pants off. She dragged her fingernails down my thighs. Her hands ran up from my legs to my stomach and back down. My cock was already bulging in my shorts. I couldn't believe she wanted to suck it. I wanted to please her, and she wanted this? But I waited, letting her take her time, touch me, feel me, her hand squeezing the bulge. Then she peeled my underwear down. She'd worked me up plenty, and my hard cock was only too happy to spring out. I exhaled, waiting for her, but she paused.
She said, "I'm scared to take off the tie. What if your cock isn't like I remember?"
"It's like you remember." I loosened the tie and took it off her.
She stared at my cock, not touching it. She didn't even blink.
"Is it okay?" I asked her.
"It's perfect." Her face came forward, and she inhaled a breath through her nose. "God, that amazing scent. It's divine. I love it." She looked up at me. "I didn't dream up this cock."
I was a little embarrassed. "No, you didn't."
"I didn't tell you before, but you have a beautiful cock."
"Thanks," I said.
Her hand wrapped around the base. She squeezed it, my mushroom head bulging purple in response. "God, look at it," she said. "I love your big balls. They're so... manly. Mmm, you're a man, a real man."
My hand was on her cheek. "I can't wait to smell your pussy again."
She smiled up at me. "You don't even care if I suck your cock, do you?"
"Not really," I said. "I want to taste you."
"You will, but we had a deal. Ladies first."
"As you wish, beautiful."
"Now hush while I please my man's cock."
Her man? I couldn't believe she said that. I was her man, at least for tonight. I loved the title. And then she kissed my cockhead. Her soft lips caressed my mushroom tip. I sighed in pleasure, and she continued kissing, taking her time with my shaft. She opened her mouth, dragging her lips across the underside of my cock. Those lips of hers were so pouty and welcoming, begging for kisses, to give and receive. I was petting her head, running my hand across her hair. Then her lips wrapped around my cockhead, and she started to lick and suck.
"Oh, that's amazing," I said, my eyes fluttering, my head rolling back. "Oh, Ginny."
"Am I doing well?" she asked me.
"Yes," I said, looking down at her.
She started sucking again, keeping my cock in her mouth as her hand worked on my shaft. She kept her eyes up, looking at me. She didn't slow down either. She kept up the rhythm on my cock, her mouth bobbing on it, her tongue working the tip, her hand working my shaft. She was picking up speed, my cockhead hitting the back of her throat. She was like a machine, possessed, like she was trying to make me cum.
"Ginny," I said, losing my breath. "Ginny, slow down. Oh, fuck. Stop, enough. Ginny."
I stepped back, taking my cock out of her mouth. I was hard and throbbing in the air, spit dripping off my shaft.
"Stop, I don't want to cum."
"Why?" she asked, still on her knees. "It'll feel good."
I reached for her, taking her by the hand and pulling her to her feet. "I don't want to feel good before you feel good," I said, "and I want to spend all night making you feel good."
She bit her lower lip. "Are you sure? You could cum in my mouth. I'll try to swallow it. We could end the night early, say our goodbyes."
I tilted my head. "I hope you're joking, beautiful. I've only just started enjoying this night."
I kissed her. She seemed surprised, because her mouth didn't move, but then her lips came to life, and she kissed me. She became more eager, sucking in a breath through her nose while our lips molded together. Her arms were once again around my neck. My hands held her hips. I walked her backwards toward the bed. She stumbled and stepped out of her high heels.
"You'll eat my pussy now?" she asked quickly.
"I'm going to devour you, beautiful."
"Oh, God. You're so good at this, aren't you?"
Her legs hit the bed. I gave her a push, and she fell onto her backside. "I'm good when I'm with you. I'm trash with anyone else."
I climbed onto the bed. Her legs started to part, but I had a lot of work to do first.
"I want to take every scrap of clothing off you," I told her.
She grinned big. "You remember what I like."
"I remember everything you like. I know your every fantasy. I know your every thought. I'm your dark secret."
My hands reached for her top. I grabbed the bottom and lifted it up. My eyes flashed bright when I saw the red lingerie she was wearing.
"Wow. You wore that?" I said with a grin, adjusting my mask. "Naughty."
She blushed with her lower lip between her teeth. "I'm not naughty. You are, undressing me like this, bringing me to a hotel, making me suck your big cock. Too naughty for a good girl like me."
I grabbed her hand and pulled her around so she rolled over. She squeaked and laughed. I used my weight to hold her down. I came up behind her, my chest right up against her back. My hand rested on her bottom.
"How naughty are you? If I lift up this skirt, am I going to see something else naughty? Because if I do, I might have to spank you."
"Oh, you wouldn't dare. I've never been spanked in my life."
My nose was in her hair, the mask in my way. I inhaled her scent deeply and groaned in exhalation. "You smell good, but I know you're naughty."
She wiggled her butt against my hand, and I groped her behind, squeezing it. Then I lifted her skirt, seeing her matching sheer red panties.
"I knew it. Bad girl."
"You wouldn't dare."
I kissed her neck and ground my hard cock into her thigh. "I wouldn't?"
"No, you w--"
I smacked her bottom, and she took a gasp.
"You did it," she said, wiggling her butt. "You're the naughty one, spanking my bottom."
I swatted her butt again. "Admit you're naughty, and I'll stop."
"Mmm, me? You're the one on top of me, spanking me, wearing a mask like a pervert. I just put on something pretty for you, and I'm getting punished for it."
I smacked her butt one more time, and she moaned.
"God, how do you know me so well?"
Both of my hands grabbed the bottom of her skirt, and I pulled it off, down her feet. She rolled over onto her back. My eyes feasted on her body, the stockings, the red panties, the teddy. I could see so much beyond all the sheer nylon.
"I don't know you half as well as I thought. Damn."
She put her arms up, stretching them high above her head, moving her chest side to side so her breasts jiggled.
"You like them, naughty boy?" she asked.
"You came here for exactly what I thought. You wanted sex."
She pouted her lips at me. "I did, but you promised me something better."
"Did I?"
"You promised me romance and fireworks."
I smirked, and then I leaned in and kissed her. "How am I doing on that promise?"
"If you keep kissing me like that, you're doing great, but please, my pussy is on fire. Can you give it a little attention?"
My hand moved down her body, my fingers dragging between her breasts, across her cute little flat tummy, to the waist of her panties. I paused there, glancing in her eyes. Then my hand moved on, and she made a "tsk" sound at me. My fingers found her garter belt. I unfastened each strap from her stockings, but how was I to take off the belt?
"How do I take off the belt?" I asked sheepishly.
"From the back. It unhooks like a bra." She rolled over and arched her back, wiggling her hips. I fumbled with the clasps for a moment until the belt came loose. She turned back around. Then I brought my hand back to her leg, resting it on her inner thigh. Her legs widened, and she pressed her thigh into my firm cock. My hand slid down, my fingertips slipping under her left stocking, pushing it all the way down her leg. I caressed her foot before repeating the exercise with her other leg.
"You know, this teddy comes off with a clasp too, right in front," she said.
"Is that so?" I said, dipping down and kissing between her breasts. My fingers found the clasps, and it did open up so easily. Her breasts were out, and she freed her arms from the lingerie. My mouth was immediately busy kissing and sucking those gorgeous nipples of hers. If she hadn't pulled me away to kiss me, I wouldn't have stopped.
"Only one thing left," she said.
I grinned at her and climbed up. She opened her legs, and I went between them. Both of my hands took her by the hips, holding the rim of her panties.
"Please," she said, "take them off."
I took them off, pulling them down her amazing, long, smooth legs. She spread those legs wide, and I stared at her nude body. Her pubic mound was bald, and her labia were pink and wet, slightly parted, as if welcoming my tongue or my fingers or my cock. Her clit was bright red, exposed, waiting.
"Holy hell, that's beautiful."
She tittered a little. "You like me?"
"I love you."
We both paused, and she seemed to turn bright red. I broke the tension by leaning forward with a kiss to her lips, my cock spearing her thigh, inches from her warm pussy. She hungrily kissed me back, and then she took my head in her hands, gripping my hair. She didn't let go. She began pushing me down her body. I followed her trail, my head moving past her breasts, her tummy, my lips kissing all the way, my freshly shaved chin dragging across her stomach.
I repositioned on the bed, lying on my hard cock, pinning it between myself and the blanket. Her legs were opening and closing slowly in invitation to taste her pussy, so soaking wet, her inner thighs a dam. I planted the first kiss right on her pubic mound, above her clit.
"God, yes, that teasing you do," she said, stroking my hair. "I've been dreaming about you so much."
I kissed my way across her pubic mound. She held a breath, watching me. My hands, meanwhile, explored her thighs, my fingertips dancing across her skin. My lips followed my fingers, kissing my way to the crevice where her leg met her pubic bone. I passed over her pussy and kissed the other thigh. Her legs were so very wide, her pussy dripping.
"You're going to make me beg you to eat my pussy, aren't you?"
I breathed a soft laugh against her wet pussy lips and then kissed them. She inhaled a sharp breath, and I looked up at her.
"We've got all night."
She touched my face and then took my hand, drawing it all the way up to her breast. She rested it there. "Can you feel my heart?"
"Yes."
"I am so excited. I want to make love to you so badly."
I opened my lips and planted a soft kiss right up against her swollen red clit.
"Oh, God. I don't know if I can wait for you to eat my pussy. I want you inside of me so much."
I took my hand back, both my arms wrapping around her thighs. I kissed her pussy again, my palm resting on her pubic mound.
"You're going to have to be patient," I said. "I've dreamed of tasting this delicious pussy too long to rush through it."
My tongue rolled out of my mouth, and I licked right across her slit, both of her little pussy lips being pulled up.
Her moan was loud and low with her mouth hanging open. "Oh, dear God. More."
I licked again, this time just one pussy lip, bottom to top. Then I brought my tongue back down and dragged it over the other. I kissed around her pussy, my breath exhaling cool air across her soaked labia. My mouth came back, and I licked along her slit again, deeper now, spreading her lips open as I moved between them.
"Fuck!" she said. "Don't make me cum."
"Why?" I asked when I paused to catch my breath. I went back in. I didn't want to talk. My tongue pushed between her pussy lips, and then I closed my mouth over her clit and gently sucked, rolling my tongue across it.
"Because I--oh, fucking hell! Because I want to save it until we make love. I want to feel it build. Please, baby?"
I glanced up at her. She called me baby? I loved it.
My tongue went to work on her, caressing her sensitive folds, moving from side to side across her clit, tasting her and savoring her deliciousness. I dipped my tongue deep into her warm little hole, wiggling and curling it. Her back arched as my tongue penetrated her. Her pussy was the nectar of the gods, sweet and tangy. I could eat for hours.
"How could I ever live without this?" she said. "I can't. I could never be with a guy who didn't eat pussy."
I didn't respond. I wasn't entirely sure she was talking to me. She was staring at the ceiling. I kept it up, my thumb brushing her clit when I had to come up for air, followed by my mouth enveloping her, sucking her and driving her mad with sensation.
"I can't take anymore!" she said. "Please, Beau, make love to me. Pretty please. I'm begging."
I pulled my lips from her pussy and stared hungrily up at her. I climbed up on all fours, crawling toward her. Her legs stretched impossibly wide to let me between them. I leaned down, kissing her lips. Our mouths were filthy, covered in spit and pussy juice, but we kissed one another like it was the end of the world. She shocked me when she grasped my cock. She squeezed and tugged on it. She was trying to angle it to her pussy. I broke our kiss long enough to sit up, to help her. I took my cock from her hand and brought the tip to her inflamed pussy.
"You want my cock inside you, baby?" I asked her.
"Yes," she said eagerly. "I can't beg anymore. I'm crazed."
"I like seeing you crazed. It drives me wild."
She grabbed the bottle of lube I'd left on the nearby end table, squeezing some into her hand. Then her fingers went between her legs. She started rubbing her pussy in a circle, spreading the lube. The other hand squeezed my cock and smeared some lube on it. "They want to be together so badly. You're so big and hard and long. Don't you want to be inside me?"
I slapped at her hand with my cock, and she immediately moved it away.
"I've wanted this pussy for so long," I said.
I pushed forward, letting my cockhead spear between her pussy lips. We shared a groan of pleasure as I penetrated her. I leaned forward, kissing her passionately while my cock slid into her deeper and deeper.
"Oh, God! It really was this amazing," she said deliriously. "I tried so hard to convince myself I remembered wrong."
I gently rocked my cock in and out of her, working it in deeper, the lube easing her passage. I started to find my rhythm as she pushed back against me. Her hands were on my back, clinging to me, her nails sharp. I held her face with one hand while I supported myself with the other. We kissed again, breathing and exhaling each other's air.
"Beau," she said, "tell me you love me again."
"You said never say it."
"Did you mean it?"
"Yes."
"Do you still feel it?"
"God, yes."
"So, tell me."
I pulled my cock back and then pushed it back into her, hard and deep, grinding my body against hers to make her moan. "I really love you, Ginny."
"Oh, God. I love you too."
She shocked me. I was completely unprepared for her to say that. "Really?"
"Only for tonight," she said, her eyes fluttering. "Just tonight. Then our love dies. Okay?"
"Hush," I said, and I kissed her. Yes, I loved her. I loved this woman with all of my heart, and I thought she was an absolute fool if she believed my love would die with the sunrise. I wondered if she truly loved me too, or if she really believed her love would die with the sunrise.
As we made love, I felt hopeful for the future. For the first time, I believed this wasn't the last time. The passion we shared, the connection, it wasn't chance, or a mistake, or a one-time thing. We'd brought fire and oil together, and we'd made a bang, a big bang, twice. I knew it could be like this forever for us, if we could somehow find our way through the mazes we'd built to keep each other out, mine filled with double lives, hers with secrets and fears.
None of that mattered now. In this moment, all that mattered is we were one, my cock sliding in and out of her, her pussy meeting me, spread open with each deep thrust, our grunts of passion filling the room between the sounds of our kissing and strained breathing.
"You're amazing," she said. "It feels so good."
"Your pussy is so tight!" I said.
I moved my hand to her hip and then I rolled over with her, bringing her on top of me. I needed a break. If I kept up this pace, I was going to cum. She sat up, putting her hands on my chest to support herself. She needed no instruction. She immediately started humping, taking little bounces on my cock to keep our rhythm going. My hands found her perfect breasts, and I cupped them, my thumbs on her nipples.
Both of her hands went higher, into her hair. I stared at her perfect body, so tall and upright atop my cock. It was getting harder not to cum. I was trying not to thrust up into her, just let her ride me, but then her hands came back down. Her right hand came to her pussy. She leaned back and started to rub it. Her mouth opened.
"I can't last," she said breathlessly. "I need to cum so badly."
"Cum for me," I said. "Let me see you cum on my cock."
"Oh, Beau," she said. "Tell me I'm yours. Please, baby."
"Your mine," I said with a growl, gripping her body. "No one else is ever going to make you feel this good."
"God, yes!"
"Tell me your pussy belongs to me," I said brazenly.
"Oh, God, yes, it's yours! I'm yours! Oh!"
Her head rolled back. Her fingers were flying across her clit with my big cock stuck in her. I thrusted upward. I only needed to give her a couple more pumps, and it was enough for her. She started screaming and dripping warm pussy juice all down my shaft and balls, creaming hard. Her knees came together, and she pulled her hand away from her pussy as she finished. She fell forward on top of me, braced by her hands, all while my cock pumped in and out of her.
She looked right into my eyes, her mouth wide open, and she screamed, "Fuck! Fuck, you're drilling me so hard! Fuck!"
I was fucking her hard, holding her hips tight, pulling her toward me each time I thrust up into her.
"God!" she screamed. "Oh, God!"
Her arms gave out and she fell on top of me, burying her face in the pillow beside my head, panting in my ear while I kept up this hard and fast pace. It was becoming too much for me. I was going to cum in her if I didn't slow down. Her nails were on my chest, and I heard her voice fast and loud in my ear.
"Please, baby! I'm so sensitive! Please, slower! Oh, God!"
"I'm gonna cum!" I said in a heavy breath.
She pulled away, and I was out of her pussy in an instant. She pivoted on her knees, and before I knew it, her mouth was around my cock. The moment she enveloped me with her lips, I exploded. I hadn't expected her to do that, and it drove me right over the edge.
"Fuck, yes, God!"
She sucked my cock and held the base with her hand as I came. She coughed, and then wrapped her lips around me again. She swallowed half my seed while the other half dripped out. All I could do was moan and watch her. I felt my cock twitching as the last of my cum shot into her mouth. I inhaled deep and exhaled hard as my orgasm subsided.
"Wow. Gentle, gentle."
She smiled big as she released my cock. "You get sensitive after you cum too?"
"Yes. God, yes."
She giggled a little and then licked my cock with her tongue. It made my whole body tense up.
"Mmm, you, sir, are yummy when you cum," she said.
I chuckled. "I am?"
"Yes. You've restored my faith in the male species."
I didn't quite know what she meant, but I chuckled. "I didn't expect that."
She licked my cock again. I sighed heavily as she handled my sensitive shaft, giving it gentle kisses. Soon, she let it go and crawled up, lying beside me. I wrapped my arm around her, and her head came to a rest on my chest.
I grabbed the sheet and blanket and pulled them up over us to keep our bodies warm as we cooled down. We were both still catching our breath. We didn't speak, both of us just staring into the darkness of the room, our thoughts our own. Mine were of this amazing woman beside me, what we'd done together, what we'd experienced, and how fortunate I felt that she was in my life. I silently prayed I could keep her somehow. It would be a colossal challenge to meet her again, but I had to have faith we could do it. Her thoughts, I supposed I would never know... unless I asked.
"What are you thinking?"
It took her a moment to respond, her hand on my stomach, caressing me. "I'm disappointed."
That was a knife to the heart. I didn't believe her. No one who made love like we just did could be disappointed. Unless she meant... "Because it's over?"
"Yes."
"We have all night, Ginny, if you want to stay."
She inhaled and exhaled. "I shouldn't."
"You should."
"But it'll make it so much harder to say goodbye."
"So, make it harder."
She held her breath for a moment, then she looked up at me. "You really want me to stay with you all night?"
"Of course," I said instantly. "Do you really want to leave?"
"No. No, I really, really don't."
"Then stay."
"Beau..."
"Ginny, I didn't stop loving you the moment I came. Stay with me, please."
She put her head back down on my chest. She was quiet for a moment. "Are you going to make love to me again?"
I kissed the top of her head. "Of course."
She gently scratched my chest. "I really didn't think it would be as good. I hoped, but... you just get better and better."
"I'm glad to hear you say that. I knew it would be better."
"You didn't know."
"I had faith," I said.
"I still can't believe I did this, met up with a stranger for sex."
"I'm not a stranger. Don't think of me like that, please."
"I don't even know your real name."
"Then let me tell it to you. Let me take off this stupid mask."
"No," she said softly. "It's going to be impossibly hard to say goodbye in the morning. I know I'm going to cry like a baby. Don't make it harder."
"You said you loved me earlier. Did you mean it?"
She was quiet again. "For tonight. Only tonight."
I smiled to myself. "I'll take it." Because I didn't believe our love would die with the sunrise.
"Can we sleep?"
"Yes," I said.
"I'm so exhausted. I didn't sleep at all after we talked last night."
"Me either."
"Will you hold me?" she asked softly. "While I sleep, I mean?"
"Of course," I said. "I'm not going to let you go, ever."
She moved up the bed. I wrapped her in my arms and our lips connected. We held our kiss, her nose bumping into the bottom of my mask, as it always did.
"I don't regret this," she said. "I know I seem distant, but I'm so happy I'm with you tonight. I'm just sad it can't last."
"I know," I said. "I really love you, Ginny. You know that, right?"
"I know," she said. "I love you too, Beau, for tonight."
"That's enough for now."
"Let me up," she said.
I freed her from my arms. "Where are you going?"
"I'll be right back."
I smiled. "You promise?"
She kissed me again. "I promise. I belong to you tonight."
As she got out of bed, I watched her nude body move across the room. She turned the lights off one by one, as well as the TV that was broadcasting the music, and then she vanished into the bathroom. I rolled onto my back and sprawled out, a huge smile on my face, feeling so happy, so excited for her to come back to me. I loved the feel of the sweat and sex all over my body. I didn't want to clean up.
When she came back out, she was still nude. But her beautiful body vanished as the bathroom light extinguished, plunging us into darkness again. She felt her way into bed, crawling, falling on top of me. I pulled the covers over her. She reached out, touching my neck, searching for my face. To my shock, she removed the mask. Her hands touched my nose, eyebrows, and forehead.
"I was worried you didn't have a nose."
I chuckled. "It's my best feature."
"I'm so tempted to see this face," she said in the darkness. Her nose bumped into mine and she kissed me. "So much better without that mask digging into my nose."
"Let me turn on the light."
"No. It'll make it harder in the morning." She put the mask on the end table, stretching over me, her warm breasts on my chest. Her lips found mine again and she said, "I can't make you sleep with such an uncomfortable thing. Don't let me see your face though, okay?"
"Okay," I whispered.
She turned around, taking my arm and pulling it around her. We moved into a spooning position. Now that my mask was out of the way, I could bury my nose in her hair and smell her properly. She was a goddess.
I kept one arm under her head and the other around her waist. She pressed her plump bottom against my crotch. I could hold her forever if she'd only let me. My mind was already chasing ideas in the night. But we were both exhausted.
"I used your toothbrush," she whispered. "Do you hate me now?"
I breathed a quiet laugh, squeezing her tight. "I think I love you more."
She didn't respond, and I thought she'd fallen asleep. My eyes fluttered just as she said, "I love you more now too."
Sleep took us.
I didn't know what time it was when Ginny began stroking my cock. I awoke in a daze. And then her hungry lips were on mine. We didn't talk. We were both quiet as we touched and caressed shadows in the night, hands exploring in the dark, gripping and squeezing body parts.
She turned away in my arms, and I was confused, thinking maybe she wanted to sleep again, but it wasn't so. She arched her back and moved her bottom toward me. With her hand between her legs, she angled my cock up. The tip touched her labia. That was all the guidance I needed.
From behind, I slipped inside of her pussy, and we both moaned. She was so slick; she must have used lube, or else she was ridiculously wet and horny. I held her tight to me, her back to my chest, a hand on her breast, the other on her tummy. We both quietly, tiredly humped against each other, half asleep, fully longing for each other.
"Ginny, I--"
"Shh. Dream."
She took my hand and put it between her legs. I rubbed her clit while my cock slid in and out of her from behind. Neither of us changed positions. We kept our steady rhythm, my thrusting, her pushing, bringing each other closer and closer to orgasm. Her breathing became heavier and heavier. She turned her head to kiss me, but our kiss didn't last long. She turned her face into the pillow and bit down on it, screaming and cumming as I fingered her clit.
"Fuck!" she said. "God, yes."
I thrust into her more, harder, using her pussy to bring myself to climax. Moments before I came in her, I pulled out. She was ready. She reached between her legs and grabbed my cock. I moaned into her ear as she stroked it, bucking and cumming everywhere between her thighs. We both settled down after that, becoming quiet again. We were both covered in sweat, cum, and pussy juice, but we didn't care. We slept.
My dreams were filled with more and more lovemaking. I wanted to wake and have her body again. And I would. As the sun started to burst between the curtains, it was my turn to take her. I kissed her like she was breakfast. The room was filling with light, and as she opened her eyes, she squinted and closed them. Her hand came up, pushing my face down into the pillow. She pulled the pillow down to obscure half of my face and crawled on top of me, straddling my waist, kissing my mouth while the pillow covered the top.
We hungrily ate each other's mouths, kissing and sucking. My cock was so very hard. She reached down between her legs, helping guide me inside her while I was completely blind under the pillow. I groaned loudly as I felt myself penetrate her hungry pussy lips.
The pillow was starting to slip, and I had one eye free. I saw her, but her eyes were closed, as if opening them might reveal the secrets of the universe she dare not know. We made love in this way, with her riding me, me thrusting up into her, but as our orgasms built, I wanted to be on top of her.
I rolled her onto her back, my face fully open and exposed in the morning light, but her eyes stayed closed. She pulled the pillow over her own head. Her hand reached for me, finding my face. I felt her nails on my jaw. I kissed her palm.
"Tell me you love me," I ordered her as I pumped my cock in and out of her.
"I love you," she said breathlessly.
"Louder. Convince me."
"I love you, Beau!" she said, panting. "I really love you!"
"Who does your pussy belong to?" I asked.
"You. God, always you!"
As my cock drove in and out of her, her legs greedily pulled me toward her. Her other hand found her pussy, and it only took a few strokes of her clit before she was screaming under the pillow, moaning, her body contorting, her legs spreading, her toes curling.
Her knees pulled back, and she tried to shut me out as her orgasm subsided and her delicate little pussy became too sensitive. I heard her breathing and moaning heavily into the pillow. I kept up my pace, making love to this beautiful headless woman.
I pulled out mere seconds before I came, exploding all over her stomach. I grabbed my cock, giving it a few strokes. Her hand found my hand. She took my cock and tugged on it. She lifted the pillow halfway up, enough to breathe easy. I kissed her exposed lips, and she kissed me back.
She said, "Mask, please."
I found it and pulled it on.
"You're safe," I said.
"You promise?"
"I promise."
I saw her pretty face again in the dim morning light.
She sighed and stared at me. "You're beautiful."
I chuckled. "You can't see me. You're the beautiful one."
"Hold me."
I lay down beside her, our nude, wet bodies sticking together, her head on my chest, my chin on the top of her head. We were both quiet for a long while, at least half an hour, my hand gently caressing her bare back, her hand petting the light hair on my happy trail.
"Thank you for an amazing night," she finally said. She sounded so sad.
"Of course. Are you okay?" I asked.
"I can't stay any longer," she said softly.
"You can. It's only 7:30 a.m. Checkout isn't until 11:00 a.m. We have hours. We could order breakfast."
"The sun is up, Beau. I have to go. I have to get away. I can't let the night spill into the day. I have to end this."
"Do you?"
"Yes. Please, you have no idea how hard this is for me."
My throat was starting to itch now. "I have no idea? I'm the one person who does have an idea."
"You don't, because you want to stay in here forever, and I'm almost stupid enough to stay with you and ruin both our lives."
"Ruin? How can something so beautiful ruin our lives?"
"Beau, please, I don't want to argue. I don't want bitterness to ruin our perfect night."
I didn't say anything, just kept silent. I had to believe this wasn't the last time, otherwise I'd never let her go.
"I just, I don't want a hard goodbye," she said. "I want to go into the shower and come out and you're just... gone. Would you do that for me?"
"If that's what you want," I said softly.
"I do. Please don't make me say goodbye. Just, just go."
"Let me clean up in the bathroom first."
"Okay," she whispered.
I left her there and went into the bathroom, looking at myself nude in the big mirror. I pulled the mask off, sighing. I cleaned up quickly, wiping myself off. I'd left a couple things in here, some deodorant, cologne, and my toothbrush. I used all three, taking two with me. I left the toothbrush for her.
Mask back on, I stepped out. She was still in bed, but the blankets were over her head. I could hear her crying under them. I sat on the edge of the bed.
"Ginny?"
She sniveled. "I can't say goodbye. I can't do it. Just go."
"Ginny, give me a hug. Don't let me leave without that. Please."
She lowered the blanket, and I saw her red eyes. She wiped her face. She sat up and threw her arms around me, hugging me tight, her heavy tears on my shoulder. I rubbed her back.
"You can still change your mind, you know?" I said.
"God, no, I can't, never again," she said. "Just give me a kiss, our last kiss, okay?"
We separated enough to bring our lips together. It was a long, wet kiss, filled with tears and spit, punctuated with gasps and sobs, and it had to end. She soon broke it, sniveling, wiping her nose with her hand.
"Damn it," she said. "I'm crying so much."
"I am too," I said.
"I don't see any tears," she said.
"They're behind my mask."
"This is really it, isn't it?"
"I hope not."
"It is," she said, taking rapid gasps. "It has to be."
"You can ask me to stay, Ginny. We could shower together, walk out of this hotel together, have breakfast together. We could spend the whole day together, stroll through the park, visit the museum, make love again tonight. We could--"
"We can't. God. I can't. Please, Beau, stop."
"Then go take your shower, Ginny."
She stood up from the bed, nude, moving to the bathroom doorframe. She flipped on the light and looked back at me.
"I loved you last night, Beau. I really did."
"I loved you too, Ginny, and I always will."
"I know," she said softly. "You are going to make some woman the happiest wife on the planet, you know?" she said, sniffling and wiping her nose again. "Like, whoever she is, she's so fucking lucky, she has no idea. I'm so jealous of her."
"And whoever she is, I'll never love her like I loved you."
She dug her palms into her eyes to push the tears out of her vision. "Damn it. Okay, I'm closing this door. That's it, okay? No stalking. No calls. No meetings. It's goodbye forever. I mean it."
I stared at her, admiring her beautiful body, memorizing her image. This wasn't really it, right? It couldn't be.
"Goodbye, Beau," she said.
"Goodbye, Ginny," I said.
She closed the door.
I heard the shower turn on. I gathered my things, dressing in jeans, a shirt, and my jacket. I put my suit back into its garment bag. Then I went to Ginny's bag and slid an envelope inside. She'd find it later. I glanced around the room, looking at it one more time, cherishing this memory. I put my key on the counter and my hand on the door.
"Beau! Beau!" Ginny called from the bathroom. I had my mask on my head. I pulled it down just as she burst out of the bathroom, her hair soaking wet. She was wearing a towel around her chest. She ran to me and crashed into me, hugging me tight.
"Damn it, I love you!"
My smile was huge. "I love you, Ginny."
She was crying hard. "I can't do this, you know? I can't meet up with you for sex and feel nothing."
"I know."
"Why did you have to be so good, so sweet, so perfect at everything? Why can't I get over you?" She wiped her eyes and looked up at me. "Tell me why?"
"The same reason I can't get over you. Because you're made for me. Because we're soulmates."
"If that's true, life would let us be together. Destiny wouldn't set us up for complete failure like this."
"Maybe it's a test to see if we really love each other, if we want to fight for this."
"I can't win this fight though. I can't. You only have to fight for yourself. I have to fight an army."
"You'll lose every battle if you always retreat."
She sniveled and hugged me hard, her face in my chest. "I hate loving you."
I breathed out, holding her tight. "I love loving you."
"Stop that. Stop it," she said, looking up at me. "Make this easier for me. Stop saying you love me. Just, just break up with me right now. Tell me it wasn't that good. Tell me you tricked me to get into my pants. Tell me it's over, and you're actually married and going to live happily ever after and laugh in my face. Do something, Beau! Make me hate you!"
I swallowed, letting her go. "You want me to make it easier?"
"Yes! Please, say something instead of the perfect fucking thing all the time. Say anything to make me believe this isn't going to crush my soul when you walk out that door."
I collected my things and moved to the door, putting my hand on it. I stared her down. "I hate that you won't fight for me. I hate that you stood me up at that fountain, that you couldn't be bothered to give me a second thought, that you forgot me, that I waited there every day for six weeks wondering if you cared. I hate that I have to love you knowing I can't have you. I hate that you won't even look at me without this mask, like you dare not see my face, because I'm not worthy of you. And I really hate that you're breaking my heart right now. I want you to ask me to stay. I want you to say we'll figure it out. I want you to say we'll take on the world together, but I know you won't, because you're a fucking coward."
Her eyes were wide. She was shaking. "Get out!"
