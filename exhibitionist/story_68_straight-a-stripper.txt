"Oh, come on! Everyone's doing it!" whined the starry-eyed 18-year-old freshman to her apprehensive roommate.
"Not in a quintillion years," Violet returned, constricting her arms beneath her well-developed C-cup chest.
"OMG, Vi. Quit acting like your parents are lurking in your closet, ready to bust you the second you have any fun!" Jasmine pressed, shaking her glowing Mediterranean curls in frustration.
Violet Owens was the quintessential nerdy good girl blessed with the looks of the classic girl next door. Her long, blonde hair was usually swept up into a bun, drawing attention to her expressive brown eyes. A smattering of freckles accented her nose and a wide smile revealed a row of perfectly straight white teeth. Her body, like her brain, was sharp. She had long legs and a slim waist, with curves that rivaled those of her exotic friend, though she was conscious to keep them concealed under conservative, loose-fitting clothing.
With the polite and sweet demeanor befitting a Southern debutante, it came as a surprise to many when she had opted to attend a notorious party school. The decision was a practical one, however. Violet's parents weren't well off and couldn't afford the high-priced tuition that came with a private university. Even with her scholarships and financial aid, she was forced to take out a number of dreaded student loans.
Her plan was to major in Applied Mathematics & Computer Science, graduate at the top of her class, and land a job that would enable her to pay off her debt in a few years. Always a stellar student, she had spent most of the first year with her nose in a textbook. Now that the semester was over and summer was in full swing, she spent her days searching for jobs and internships. The only success she'd had was securing a meeting to be the TA for an introductory coding class next term.
"I'm sorry, I don't feel like objectifying myself to a horde of wasted dudes," Violet stated flatly to her overzealous roommate.
The popular brunette wasn't having it. "It's National Nude Day! And you're so pretty! I bet you have a rocking body under those potato sacks you insist on wearing," Jasmine coaxed, her eyes pleading.
"You only want me there so you have a DD if you end up wasted again. That's what ride-sharing is for," Violet countered.
"You know what, fine! Stay here in this lame ass dorm, fuck me for trying to get you out of your comfort zone," Jasmine huffed.
Violet's heart sank. For all their differences, she and Jasmine had grown close that year. The impulsive brunette had taken her under her social wing, tolerating her reclusive quirks, and been a gateway for new friendships.
"It's just not my scene, Jazz."
Jasmine moved to her side of the room in front of the full-length mirror. "Doesn't even mean you have to flaunt everything, just wear your undies," she mumbled, removing her top and tossing it on her bed.
Violet sighed knowing her friend had a point. "You're right," she said reluctantly. "But I have this meeting to be a TA tomorrow-"
Her eyes slid down her roommate's physique, envious of Jasmine's olive skin. She looked like a porcelain doll in contrast. The dark-haired girl turned around, her 36D breasts sitting high and proud within the confines of her purple lacey bra.
"How do I look?"
"You're actually going to the party like that?"
Jasmine raised her brows and gave a teasing shrug. "You have your whole life to be all old and responsible. Only a short time to make mistakes." And with that, the boisterous girl slipped out into the hall.
*****
An hour later, Violet's phone started buzzing relentlessly. All she wanted to do was read her book, but her roommate didn't give up easily. Out of what she could decipher from Jasmine's emoji-riddled texts, the outgoing co-ed was practically begging her to join the fray:
"Where RU? This is like the biggest party of the year—music, free booze, boys, keg stands, jello shots!"
Violet rolled her eyes. Why were girls her age so thirsty? There's a rager every week and a million desperate horny guys all over campus.
Longing for a distraction, she peeked into the hallway. It was deserted, except for the faint video game noises coming from Lionel's room across the hall. Poor Lionel, with his pimply complexion and crippling shyness around girls. Violet quickly shut her door. Perhaps her mother was right. During spring break, she had been peppered with questions about her social life, or lack thereof. She couldn't remember the last time she had done anything reckless and impulsive. Even losing her virginity to her ex-boyfriend had been about as boring and laborious as it could get.
Fueled by a sudden wave of determination, she grabbed her phone and texted Jasmine, "Okay. Where are you?"
The device pinged back almost instantaneously: "745 E Belmont."
The address was about a 13-minute walk. Doable.
She went to the mirror and slid her hands down her sides. Then she pulled off her shirt and undid her jeans, leaving her in just her bra and panties. Pulling the puffy, dark indigo-blue robe from her closet, the tall blonde wrapped it tightly around herself and then slipped on her pink flip-flops.
Checking her appearance, she decided to let her hair down and put on a bit of makeup. As the silky blonde strands cascaded over her shoulders, she brushed them back behind her ears. Carefully, she applied some mascara, a touch of blush, and a coat of her favorite bubble-gum flavored lip gloss to her plump lips. She felt a mix of excitement and dread.
Stepping out of the elevator and through the sliding doors of the building, she clutched the robe around her tightly. The night air was cool and seemed to whip up between her thighs, sending a shiver through her. She had opted for her most comfortable, least revealing panties, still uncertain about this whole "National Nude Day" business.
Her phone buzzed again with another message from Jasmine. "Hurry up! You won't regret this!"
*****
745 E Belmont.
It was the address Jasmine had texted her, a place off-campus that was supposedly the epicenter of the night's festivities. As Violet approached the house, she could hear the distant thrum of bass and laughter. She hesitated at the door, her heart pounding. She could count the number of ragers she'd been to on one hand. Taking a deep breath, she knocked lightly.
A shirtless guy with a goatee wearing a sombrero opened the door.
"Well hello!" he exclaimed, leaning against the doorway.
Violet cringed inwardly. "Uh, hi."
He looked her up and down, a mischievous grin forming across his face. "Nice... You're super early."
"Huh? I'm sorry, I-"
He laughed and grabbed her hand. "Come on in," he shouted over the music, leading her inside.
It was dark as the host weaved them through the house, past a deserted poker table, and toward a den in the back. Violet glanced around nervously. The scene felt off; it didn't look like your typical college kegger.
"Where is everyone?" she asked, noticing the absence of beer pong, strobe lights, and drunken, hormonal students. The guy shook his head and put a finger to his lips, shushing her.
They were standing outside the den.
"Put this on, quick," he whispered, holding out something black.
"A blindfold?" Violet's voice wavered, but before she could protest, the guy was already tying it around her head.
The next thing she knew, he had placed his hand on the small of her back and was guiding her into the room. A second later, the music cut out, and she heard a butter knife clink against a glass.
"Gentleman! The entertainment has arrived," he announced. She registered the grip on the back collar of her robe just before it was yanked and she was pushed forward, knocking her off balance as the fabric slipped off her shoulders.
"Um, wha-!" She stumbled into someone's arms. The guy smelled like Old-timey spice and brandy. Her skin prickled, suddenly exposed. She tugged at the material blocking her eyes and found herself in a room filled with men in their late twenties to mid-forties. Some wore suits and ties, but some had shed their shirts and were sporting dumb party hats and sunglasses. All of them stared at her. There was something in the air. An energy mixed with cigar smoke and the pungency of unadulterated testosterone. Judging by the "Last Days of Freedom," banner hanging overhead, she had accidentally crashed a bachelor party.
"Hey! Who invited the stripper?" a balding guy in a pink polo called out. The room erupted in hoots and applause.
Violet's eyes widened in shock. She turned to leave, but the path closed behind her.
"Hey, hey, don't be shy! The party's just getting started," a dark-haired man in an unbuttoned Hawaiin shirt drawled, slapping a palm to her ass.
"I think I'm in the wrong place," Violet stammered, but the men weren't listening.
The sombrero guy tossed her robe on a nearby leather recliner and reached into his back pocket.
"I gotchu, sweetheart," he said, holding up his wallet. A fat wad of cash poked out from it. He extracted some bills and waved the currency in front of her. The rest of the men took it as a cue and started digging into their pockets.
Violet began to refuse, shaking her head, but her eyes widened as she caught sight of the money. These weren't just a few crumpled bills; these were hundred-dollar notes, crisp and numerous. The young blonde swallowed hard. He was holding over a thousand dollars.
Textbooks, food, clothes, gas, parking—everything cost money. Whoever believed college towns were affordable probably hadn't attended college in the last decade. She could work every summer until she graduated and still not make a dent in her debt.
An internal battle waged within her: pride and dignity versus common sense and need. She thought about her options. Walking away meant holding onto her pride, but it also meant years of living paycheck to paycheck.
Her pragmatic side began to eclipse her reservations. This opportunity was fleeting. These guys looked so inebriated already, she probably wouldn't even have to stay long to earn some serious dough. But the more she protested, the higher the chance they'd catch on to the fact that she wasn't an actual stripper...
To her right was a tray of shots, each filled high with a gold concoction of liquid confidence. Without another thought, Violet reached and downed, not one but three of the glasses.
"So, who's the lucky one getting married?" she coughed while blinking away tears. They were more potent than she was used to. Regardless, she needed to sell that she was a professional entertainer. Strutting through the room she boldly made it a few feet before stumbling as her flip-flops caught on the carpet.
A few wolf whistles came from the back as she bent forward to catch herself. She had never been this exposed in front of so many people outside of the beach.
"Right this way." The sombrero man was back, wrapping his arm around her waist and guiding her toward the giant TV. Violet felt her stomach flip as she saw the man of the hour. A shirtless, heavyset douche in his late thirties with a combover and a face as red as a tomato, looked back at her through bleary hazel eyes.
"Whassat?" he slurred, gesturing with a beer in his hand and sloshing its contents on the ground.
Sombrero guy whispered to Violet, "This is my boy, Brian. As you can see, he's pretty shitfaced already, so go easy on him," before slipping a couple bills down the side of her panties.
The scantily clad woman bit her lip. This was it, her last second to back out.
"Hi, Brian," she said to the half-lidded man with the idiot grin. I'm... V-Vixen." Violet blushed at how stupid she sounded. She had only witnessed these scenes in movies. Assuming the persona of her alter ego, Violet plastered a sexy smile on her face, trying her best to appear alluring and unflustered.
In the back, one of the bachelors flipped the playlist to a slow jam with heavy bass.
Swaying her hips to the rhythm, she closed her eyes and ran her hands through her hair. The feel of her smooth locks and the smell of her favorite floral-scented conditioner flooded her with a sudden rush of confidence.
I'm sexy, she told herself. A modern femme fatale. Not timid, not shy, not some meek Violet. A siren, a Vixen. I've got this.
Stepping out of her flip-flops, she let her toes curl into the carpet as her nervousness receded and her lust for money and excitement took over.
She leaned forward with her long legs spread apart and straddled the large man's lap, placing her hands on his hairy shoulders to steady herself. The heat radiating from his sweaty body was unsettling, but not unbearable. The man weighed enough that the cushions sunk low, causing her to tilt forward against his potbelly. Her stomach churned as the man placed his meaty paws on the side of her ribs.
"You smell good, babygirl. I bet you taste sweet." The drunkard grinned like the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood, his breath hot and stinging against her neck.
With a shudder, she locked eyes with him and started gyrating her hips to the synth progression.
"Seems like you have had quite the night already," the brown-eyed beauty observed.
"Just gettin' started," Brian replied with a toothy grin before belching unceremoniously.
Violet did her best not to gag from the smell of his sour breath. "Well," she rasped. "You seem like a real catch."
"Lose the bra, honey!" a man catcalled in the back.
Acutely aware of the growing erection pressing against her inner thighs, she continued undulating her hips and grinding against her prey.
"Don't be a tease! Lose it." another voice growled.
Brian licked his chapped, cracked lips, lewdly staring at her bra as if he were considering snagging it off with his teeth.
"Ah, I uh, umEE!" She squealed, feeling multiple hands start sloppily sticking bills into the waistband of her panties and then letting the elastic snap back like a rubber band.
Her resolve waned and the delusion she'd created in her mind crumbled. Her insecurities came bubbling back to the surface. She didn't have a clue what she was doing, did she? She was just some kid. An awkward nerd. She wasn't like those popular girls who paraded around campus in tube tops and fuck me pumps. She wasn't Jasmine...
Her heart thumped in her ears, threatening to beat out of her chest. She couldn't breathe. She could feel herself beginning to hyperventilate. Was she going to pass out giving a lap dance? Half naked in front of a bunch of men with her tits spilling out. A hot and sweaty mess. The prospect was daunting.
"Hey!" Violet was snapped out of her daze as the balding guy in the pink polo pushed another glass of the brown liquor into her hand. The nervous teen glanced behind her. The men's faces were lit with desire.
"Thanks." She took the glass and tossed her head back for the fourth time. It went down smoother. The alcohol's warmth coursed through her veins. The bass rattled her bones as she reached back to unclasp her bra. It slipped off her chest onto the floor. More whistles and cheers greeted her as her ample boobs bounced free. She felt the weight and the sensation of the humidity against her hardening nipples.
Brian's erect cock jerked against her thighs. Violet felt her pussy twitch. It was so surreal. An hour ago she was up in her dorm jotting notes in her journal. Now she was stripping naked in front of a group of strangers for money like a whore.
"Shiiit. This bitch has some big titties!"
Violet couldn't help but smirk. These guys were so dumb.
Brian's pudgy hands swept from her hips to the swell of her behind. He squeezed and pulled her in until her boobs brushed his chin. Taking in the faint feminine musk of perfume and sweat, his stubbled cheeks rubbed against the silky skin of her breasts.
"Hey now!" Violet gasped, placing her palms against his chest and attempting to scoot backwards.
"Ahhh, relax love. Don't be shy!" Another hand caught her shoulder and held her.
"Ah! Nn-" Violet's pussy quivered as Brian let go of her buttocks and began exploring the rest of her body. She continued to undulate in time with the music as his palms traced down her taut belly to the hem of her panties and across her slit. He rubbed his index finger back and forth over the material until he felt her clitoral hood and began thumbing it. She shivered as he teased her, instinctively rocking her hips to the pleasurable sensation.
"I think she's loosening up!" chortled Brian as he held up two fingers and brought them to his bulbous nose.
The groom grinned at her like the cat who got the canary. His hungry fingers returned to the flimsy fabric of her panties and pulled the back forward until they cut deeply between her ass cheeks. He hooked his thumb over the seam and yanked the material aside. Violet whimpered softly as the cool air met her damp folds.
"Nngh!" The blonde was now a flushed, horny mess. Sweat was building on her back. She shouldn't have drunk whatever that was on an empty stomach. Her head felt super fuzzy. The alarm bells rang but the booze made them muffled and distant.
How did other girls do this for hours at a time? And why couldn't she stop grinding against this bastard? The thought of being objectified by all these men, and their hard rods was starting to excite her.
"Vixen!!" "Shake dat ass!" "Squeeze Dem Titties!!" the guys cheered, between swigs of their beer.
Her feet dangled off the floor, her bare toes unable to touch the carpet. Her arms wrapped around the back of Brian's thick neck as his hands continued to fondle her. Somewhere in the commotion, he'd managed to unclasp his belt and push his slacks down his thighs. His throbbing cock pressed firmly against her tummy. She hadn't had sex in months and she wasn't used to this level of attention. It sent her libido soaring. She'd always been the brainy shy one. But these guys... they wanted her. Wanted her body. Hell, they were willing to pay for it.
In a move that would have mortified her sober self, Violet reached back, took the back of the man's head, and pressed his face to her tits. His lips connected with her nipple, and he immediately began suckling it like a newborn. Violet winced, his teeth skimming her tender nub. In her sheltered 18 years, her boobs had barely had any real stimulation since puberty. His tongue was almost too much. The wet slurping felt indescribably good, all well his gluttonous fingers massaged the toned globes of her ass.
His dick wasn't huge but compared to her tiny-packaged ex it was like a python, throbbing and alive, wanting nothing more than to slither all the way into her warm nest. The feeling of pressure on her crotch also sent happy thrills from her belly up. The fact that she was so hot and bothered in a room full of spectators... She'd never imagined anything even remotely kinky like this.
He slurred, "Wanna fuck you." The feeling of his drool pooling around her tits was so gross. Her chest heaved. A strand of saliva connected his chin to her pink right nipple.
"Ha...I don't think that's a good idea." Violet shook her head, embarrassed.
But the groom-to-be was insistent. "Five grand... TEN, Fuck you right here. Right now." The motherfucker's grip became an iron cuff on her wrist.
That's when Sombrero Guy appeared beside them again. He looked at his friend and chuckled, "Alright Brian, I think that might be enough. Wouldn't want to do anything Georgia wouldn't like," clearly trying to keep the party in check.
"Fuck Georgia. And fuck off Whitney!!!" he slurred drunkenly, "Can't you see the girls considering it?!"
Violet blinked as her clouded brain, fogged with arousal and indecision, struggled to summon words. The sleazy man with the comb-over tweaked her boob again with his slippery tongue, running it across the circumference of her puffy areola. He then lifted his face to her ear.
"$10 grand to tame that cute pussy of yours. All ya gotta do is sit there. We got a deal?"
There was no denying her altered state. Drunker, stupider, hornier, and more reckless than normal. But also more courageous.
Violet gulped and slowly nodded, "$10,000? You P-Promise?" Her heart hammered. Was she really agreeing to get fucked in front of a group of horny, lecherous men? No, Vixen was, she rationed. As far as all of these dudes were concerned she was just some two-bit stripper who they'd never see again, not an upstanding student on honor roll.
Sombrero Guy seemed taken aback. He turned to Violet. "Are you sure? I mean Candice was pretty clear on the policy-"
"I'll make an exception," the blonde minx curtly cut him off, lifting herself just enough to shimmy her soused panties down her thighs.
Brian's eyes dilated in lust at the sight of the teen's smooth shaved cunt and pussy lips, which were already swollen and moist with arousal. She slid off his lap and she stood up, kicking the underwear aside. For the first time, she was completely exposed to everyone in the room. She felt her cunt drip as the men's eyes all stared at her body. There must be at least a dozen and a half gawking bachelors, all ogling the hot blonde with the tight pink slit and the heavy set of udders hanging from her glistening chest.
They saw their friend fuss with dispatching his pants and boxers. His fleshy cock, wet with precum, bobbed as he wriggled his ass on the chair. The young woman shuddered. Her eyes scanned his body, a mass of greasy hair on his chest and around his navel leading to his puffy ballsack. She lifted a leg, her dominant hand shakily grabbed the base of his shaft. His cock was like a red-hot steel pole in her hands as she guided the throbbing swollen purple head slid to the folds of her pussy.
"Unnnhh" Violet let out a long sigh and lowered herself. Her lips stretched to envelop his cockhead with a lewd sucking noise as her hole immediately squeezed around the intruder.
Brian groaned in ecstasy as he watched the tip disappear into Violet's wet slit. She was more tight than he expected for a stripper.
"Fuck me!" he growled trying to drive his girth to the hilt through her velvety, hot insides so he could grind against her cervix.
A mix of pain shot through the inexperienced freshman. The man's penis felt so erect, it was like being speared with a hard bone. Her snatch didn't want to take more than the first couple of inches. She clenched her jaw and whipped her head back and forth, hair flying over her sweaty face, forehead vein popping. Her mind raced. What the hell was she doing? This was bad. He was going to split her in two. This was a mistake.
"Waiit!" The girl shrieked, and then moaned, arching her hips as Brian strenuously impaled his thick meat into her wet passage. Her inner muscles compressed around the pulsing member until it finally bottomed out, and she found her ass resting firmly against the man's pelvis.
The young girl whimpered, her entire body tensing as waves of feverish goosebumps ran across her skin in an attempt to acclimate to the penis inside her. Brian wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her as close as she could get. He licked the shell of her ear.
"Mmm, I thought you were just a tease," he jeered, rolling his hips and making the hot blonde cry out.
"Ooooh fuck," a loud moan escaped her throat. He began to buck.
"No! Ngh!" The horny teenager dug her fingers into his beefy shoulder, desperately trying to hold herself steady as the older man pistoned in and out of her pussy with quick, hard strokes.
Her toes curled and her knees wobbled as she felt the thick root twitching inside her, deeper than she'd ever felt before. The unfamiliar feeling of a foreign body was so raw and visceral, it took a minute for the discomfort to subside and eventually give way to pleasure.
Biting her bee-stung lips in an attempt to control her cries only made the sounds coming from her throat more sensual and obscene.
"Uhnn! Uhnn!" Her tits jiggled up and down in rhythm to Brian's pounding.
The lecherous noises of their sloppy genitals squishing against each other reached a crescendo as she began bouncing on his lap.
"Yeah, that's right baby. I know you wanted this!" The ugly man smacked her bum, dick drilling mercilessly like a jackhammer.
Violet's draw dropped as she lost herself in the sensation. It felt amazing. She rocked back and forth, then collapsed into him. Their bodies pressed together in a sweaty embrace as they began to move in sync, fucking to the rhythm of the music.
She moaned into the unfaithful man's chest, brown eyes rolling to the back of her head, drunk on both liquor and cock. Her breathing came out in ragged pants. Each orgasm tore through her.
The crowd of men watched in awe, as her lithe, teenage body shook on top of the drunken friend, her pussy milking his throbbing penis. She could feel their eyes on her. Watching her impale herself. It made her gush. Her legs shook, her thighs squeezed. She wanted it deeper. Harder.
Forever.
"Knock her up!" someone screamed from the crowd.
Violet's eyes shot open and she gasped. The comment was so obscene it caught her off guard. She never wanted kids. Not until she was married with a good career at least. She was too young.
But something about the idea of getting fucked and impregnated by an absolute stranger in public filled her with a dark, twisted sense of pleasure.
Her mind went into overdrive. She conjured it. Her belly round and protruding, her boobs leaking milk. They'd get bigger too. She'd always considered her boobs an inconvenience. Less space to write when doing notes. But if she had a baby... Maybe that wouldn't be so bad? And what of her parents? How would they react to their little bookworm becoming a single teen mother? The shame. The disappointment. The betrayal.
Her pussy contracted violently at the thought. Violet groaned. Her mouth opened wide, her face contorting in an expression of bliss as waves of another climax rolled through her body. She felt like she was melting into Brian's chest. Her hands gripped his fat arms, holding onto him like a lifeboat as she came harder than ever before. Her lips clamped onto his neck. She kissed and sucked on his flesh. She didn't care that the dumb bastard smelled like beer and sweat, he was her savior, giving her body what it craved, fucking her, pounding his big veiny fuckstick into her pussy again and again. She'd never come this hard again, she was sure of it. The orgasm consumed her mind, body and soul. She resigned to lapping at his skin as her body twitched with the aftershocks.
When she came to, her senses returned, and the haze lifted. She could feel her face flush bright red.
"I just... Oh God. I'm sorry," Violet babbled as she loosened her grasp and saw the red marks from her nails.
Brian grunted like a pig and buried his cock balls-deep in her cunt. His dick shuddered and throbbed deep within her pussy like a cartoon grenade. The next second she felt a hot blast of liquid filling her womb.
"Oh," the young woman whispered. The warmth spread through her abdomen, the sensation surprisingly pleasant. She knew it was wrong. So wrong. All that man's warm, sticky semen coating her insides. The smug satisfaction in his hazel eyes.
She traced the contour of her lover's jaw with her finger. It was like she had drunk from a river of ambrosia, her brain rattling off all the hormones that she'd memorized in chemistry class: dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, oxytocin, all of them slushing around in her head as a result of being used as a fuck toy in front of a bunch of perverts.
This nearly married man, though conventionally unattractive by every reasonable metric, had made her feel things she had never experienced in her existence. She leaned in and gave him a deep, sensual kiss. His cock twitched and a few smaller warm jets of fluid shot into her cunt as his hands dropped from her ass to his sides.
Her bubble-gum flavored lips peeled back from her teeth, breaking her lock on the sot's fat tongue. She pulled away from him gasping for air. His heavy load leaked down her thighs. Violet felt lightheaded as she pushed herself off of him, wincing as the softening dick slid from her stretched pussy lips like a giant slug. The trail of their sinful juices clotted into globs which sullied the carpet.
"Shit. That was awesome," cried one of the spectators. She looked at the man and found, to her horror, that much of the audience had their phones out and were recording everything. Her stomach lurched. A few guys had their hands down their pants and were blatantly stroking their erections. Nearly all of them had bulges tenting their suit trousers.
One of the more handsome ones, with slicked-back blonde hair, approached the flustered teen and waved a roll of crisp hundreds in her face. "Whaddaya say, up for another go? We'll make it worth your while."
Violet did a double take. "We'll?" she squeaked.
His buddies smiled over her shoulders like a pack of hungry hyenas. Something about seeing her get fucked so senseless was like catnip to them.
Violet didn't want to move, she wanted to lie down and take a nap. The money was tempting, though. And a part of her, a primal side of her that had literally just awakened, felt her juicy pussy begging for more.
As her vision blurred in and out, she concentrated on her cum glazed legs, like hot fudge on a sundae, her pussy lips quivered in anticipation of more fat cocks. Should she quit school? It would be so easy, paying her bills with her tits. Just slutting her brains out. A sea of men coming in to fuck and use her... All those orgasms, All the things she could buy...
A lazy grin spread across her lips. She looked up and nodded dumbly. "How could I turn down an offer like that?"
*** 1 Hour Later ***
"AH!! Yes, God, Yes!" Violet's naked body writhed as she rode her latest john. Her vag was sore, her thighs burned from exertion, her belly felt swollen and bloated, full of hot semen, and yet the feeling was strangely soothing.
The men lined up, eager as a bunch of schoolchildren surrounding a chubby Pinata. Instead of candy, they all wanted a piece of the sexy teen in the middle of the living room. Many masturbated as their friends plowed her willing cunt.
The few upstanding husbands and boyfriends had long but checked out, yet at least a dozen of the rogue bunch remained.
*** 2 Hours Later ***
She was beginning to lose count of how many loads were inside her. She had been spit roasted twice, cowgirl, doggystyle... So... seven dicks? Lucky number seven. Or was it eight? Her mind was a haze, overstimulated and invigorated. Her body tingled like a live wire. Every nerve electrified. There was no time to blink away the full facial she just received, the fresh cum still dripping from her lashes. The next guy in line was on her, stealing her anal virginity.
The more she fucked and drank, the more she came, the more she was willing to do, and the fatter the stack of cash on the night table became. She was currently making out with a man old enough to be her father. Her breasts ached as they had been groped and sucked at so much. She had hickeys all over. She was starting to like the sound her pretty little pussy made as it choked on each new slab of meat, as well as the wet sloppy unmistakably naughty slapping every time her butt slammed down on the fat base of each penis, spreading apart her reddened, aching lips to the max.
Her libido was dragging her down a path of ruin and depravity. Somewhere in the back of her mind, the college freshman wondered if she'd gone crazy. She didn't care. She was hooked.
*** 3 Hours Later ***
Always the smart one, the well-mannered, bookish, model child. Violet's hair was plastered to her face in sweat, cum was smeared over her lips, dripping from her chin. Her cheeks and breasts were bright red. She moaned, a mixture of lust and pain as her asshole stretched open. She was on autopilot. A man with red pubic hair lined up in front of her face and fed her his thick cock, groaning as he began thrusting into her mouth. The blonde's throat vibrated around the hard shaft as the two men double-penetrated her. Her hands gripped his balls massaging them. She could smell her own pussy on his groin.
"Ohhh Vixx! Mmph!" His cock hit the back of her throat.
She'd be burping jizz for the next week. She closed her eyes, feeling a familiar twinge in her pelvis. She was getting close. Again.
*** Noon ***
When she eventually awoke at noon, having passed out in exhaust naked and covered in bodily secretions, she was alone. The teen's head throbbed like it had been cracked open. Her first thought was that she slept through her morning classes. She groaned and sat up.
Had she been run over by a truck? Or was she sick? Her throat felt like sandpaper, her legs were jelly, her ass ached, her tits were raw, and pussy swollen and tender. She had trouble opening her left eye.
She tried to remember. She had gone to meet Jasmine at a party. But where was she? A flash. Sombrero. Bachelor Party. Her robe falling to the wayside. Oh my God! The memories came flooding back. Violet's hand flew to her mouth.
"Oh, fuck. Oh no. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck!" the young woman said, shaking her head.
She scrambled for her phone, which had slid under the leather couch, and checked for messages.
Missed texts from her roommate:
"745 E Belmont."
"Hurry up! You won't regret this!"
10 minutes later: "Oh, I mean W Belmont btw, sorry!"
"Hey, R U here?"
"R u ok? Let me know when ur coming home."
Then two missed calls from Jasmine an hour ago.
Violet let the phone fall from her hands. Ignoring the way her body complained, she forced herself up. She cringed at the feel of the crusty dried cum on her thighs, her vagina felt chapped. It took her a minute to locate her robe. The place seemed empty and the room was pretty trashed. On the coffee table were two envelopes labeled "Vixen." Inside was a stack of bills with more cash than she'd ever seen at once. She would count it later. She didn't want to stick around any longer than she already had.
Her TA meeting was at 4 and she needed to make a good first impression. It wasn't until she was getting into her rideshare that she realized just how much of a slutty disaster she must look like. Her reflection was shocking. Dried cum was visible in her rat's nest hair. All her makeup had melted off. Her eyes were bloodshot, and her neck was covered in bite marks. A bruise on her cheekbone had formed overnight.
She nonchalantly tried sniffing her armpit only for her nostrils to be assaulted by the pungent aroma of cock and pussy.
She gave the driver an apologetic smile and told him the address. He grimaced in disdain. She didn't blame him, he would need a blow torch to cleanse her seat. But even as her cheeks flushed in embarrassment and mortification, her mind filled with memories of perverse pleasure.
It was like there were two different versions of her now, Violet and Vixen, and one had hijacked her body and taken it on a wild ride.
Violet wasn't sure which one was the real her. She felt a strange sense of accomplishment and shame, pride and self-loathing. But the way her heart raced as every pothole and bump during the ride sent twinges of pleasure to her crotch, she absentmindedly wondered how the driver would respond if she parted her legs and began rubbing her sore clit while making eye contact with him. She bit her lip thinking about exposing herself to the man and then seducing the wedding ring right off his finger.
*** 4PM ***
"Hello, Ms. Tanner! I'm Violet!" She had spent forty minutes in the shower and then another twenty putting on makeup to undo the night's debauchery. She was dressed in a super conservative turtleneck sweater and slacks with a folder of references and class notes tucked under her arm.
The professor was a distinguished woman, middle-aged, with dark hair, dressed in a professional blazer and dress pants. She looked at Violet with the same approval she had grown accustomed to as a top student, choosing her as a teaching assistant for her coding class was a no-brainer.
"Violet! It's nice to meet you. You come highly recommended. Please call me Georgia, especially because I won't even be Ms. Tanner very much longer. I'm getting married next week."
"Wow! That's wonderful," the blonde gushed, shaking the woman's hand.
Georgia smiled. "So, let's start with you telling me about yourself, Violet. I've seen your transcript and know that you are a brilliant student, so I consider this a good fit on paper, but this is a demanding position requiring a lot of trust. I would like to know more about who you are as a person."
"Well," Violet shifted. She looked down at the desk, trying to hide her nervous expression.
"I'm very organized and I'm a hard worker. I love helping people. And I've worked as a tutor before."
"Excellent." The professor leaned back in her chair, a small smile on her lips.
"I see you're ahead in your credits. What is your passion? Why are you interested in this position?"
"My passion is..." She stopped short, her brain drawing a blank. She felt like such an idiot. She'd answered this question a million times before. Why was her mind so addled?
Focus. What was her passion? Was it sex? Fucking men? Being used like a toy? She felt her pussy twitch. All the clothes and foundation in the world couldn't hide her true nature. The prim and proper façade was nothing more than a mask.
She gulped and looked at the older woman's face. The professor suddenly lit up, her attention drawn over Violet's shoulder. "Speak of the devil!" she exclaimed."Hello, darling." Georgia moved past her frozen TA.
"Sorry to interrupt," said the man behind her. The hairs on the back of Violet's neck went rigid.
"Honey, this is Violet. She's my new TA. Violet, this is Brian, my fiance. What a coincidence I was just telling her we were getting married."
Violet turned her head. Standing there was a portly man. His thick black hair had a bad combover, a big beer belly, and a face like a frog. It was strange seeing him not out of breath and sweating profusely. He was holding a cup of coffee and smiling brightly.
Violet immediately felt her heart drop. She assumed they'd both be extremely embarrassed but when his eyes registered who she was his grin just widened.
"Hi Violet, nice to meet you. Georgia doesn't let just anyone help her teach her students, you must be a very special girl," he said smoothly.
Violet stared back, mouth agape. This wasn't happening. Georgia beamed proudly as she gave her partner a kiss.
"Oop, what happened here?" Her finger traced a scratch along the side of his neck. Violet felt like she was going to vomit.
"I thought you said you didn't get into any trouble last night," Georgia smirked, then said to Violet. "It was his bachelor party last night."
"Oh, this is nothing. Must have drank too much and cut myself."
The professor chuckled, shaking her head.
"So, how are you liking the university, Violet? Any boyfriends?" Brian asked casually.
"I- uh-" Violet stammered.
Brian snapped his fingers. "That reminds me, honey, you've got such a busy schedule what with all the commitments this week. Maybe Violet wouldn't mind stopping by to collect those boxes you left at the house from last semester."
"What a good idea! Would you mind doing that, Violet? It's only a 15-minute drive from here, and it shouldn't take more than a couple runs."
"Yes, of course, not a problem," she chirped, unable to take her eyes off the groom.
"Wonderful! Thank you so much, darling," Georgia replied, visibly relieved.
Brian smiled back. "Just knock and I'll make sure to stay close to home. Thanks so much, Vixen, I mean Violet."
The blonde's knees buckled. Her pussy throbbed at the thought of the man having the audacity to solicit her in front of his betrothed.
"It's no problem," she choked out, her voice cracking.
Her professor frowned slightly, leaning in to touch the other girl's arm, concerned. "Are you okay, dear?"
Violet nodded quickly. "No, yeah, I'm fine. Just tired. I stayed up late updating my résumé," she lied.
"I know the feeling all too well. Wouldn't expect anything less from a smart young woman like you," Georgia replied. "Speaking of appointments, don't think you've escaped shuttle duty, mister. Did you get my parent's itinerary?"
"It's on my phone, dear." Brian nodded.
"Well," Georgia continued, turning back to Violet, "I don't mean to cut this short, sweetie, but it's clear you're a great candidate for the TA position. I have a dress fitting soon, and I need to make sure my husband-to-be knows his marching orders. Otherwise, he's bound to bring back the wrong mother-in-law from the airport," she joked.
"Of course," Violet replied.
As she watched the couple depart, she slumped against the wall to collect her wits, hand gingerly cradling her lower abdomen. Her knees were still quivering, her little pussy burning up just thinking of those beady-eyed lips suckling her tits, the feeling of the hot creamy cum firing deep inside her, all those dicks plugging every orifice. It felt so weird watching Georgia treat Brian with such affection. How could she be so oblivious? The man was a creep, a cheater, and a sleaze. So vulgar and uncouth.
Her stomach grumbled, the primordial stew of every thick cock she had met in her asshole sloshing around in her gut. It was like she could still feel his breath on her neck. All those men, thrusting into her tight twat, cumming on her cheeks and lips. She felt so confused. So conflicted.
This year was going to be tough. Where yesterday her shy and sensible self thought she had her life figured out, now her priorities were impossible to sort. Everything was up in the air. She bit her lip coyly. No matter how things panned though, she did know one thing for certain. She was going to need sex, and a lot of it.
