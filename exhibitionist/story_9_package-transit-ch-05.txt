The Devil on Your Shoulder:My my Anastasia...how things have changed for you.
You:They have changed quite a bit, haven't they.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:And it's all because of your own efforts -
You:It is not, all these things went down around me and they just...happened to bring me good fortune. I'm not the cause of any of this.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:"Much of our suffering comes from trying to control those things which we can't control." You, however, have taken them - that one out of ten things that you're actually able to affect - and made them yours. You steered your own ship, even if you couldn't command the waves themselves.
You:Who are you quoting? I should know, shouldn't I?
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Socrates. You heard it it in your high school philosophy class back in the day...remember? Ah...maybe not. It doesn't really matter. "Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift from All Above Heaven, which is why we call it -"
You:Oh no come on, you go from quoting Socrates to -
The Devil on Your Shoulder:- the present. :)
You:Kung-Fu Panda.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Ah, but see Anastasia, you actually remember where that one came from because it's significant. Stop denying what you have built for yourself against all odds for once, will you? Look at how things have changed for you in just four weeks - remember back when you wouldn't even talk to me? When you were ohhh sooo sure that everything was doomed to disaster?
Once again, that fiendish presence perched upon your shoulder, speaking in your own voice with greater confidence than you yourself could ever muster (to anyone but Aram or Tiberius, truth be told) was absolutely correct. You ruminate over the sudden transformation of your fortunes - once you were like a pretty blue-bottle, flitting nervously beneath the shadows of flowers, but you'd changed into a radiant dragonfly...something that was regarded with a curious mix of awe and fear. You always had your fill now. Indeed, ever since you'd grown involved with Tiberius at your workplace you'd discovered a kink in the legalistic armor of your employer.
He'd gotten his hands on the security footage of Mahmud sealing the doors to keep the rioters from breaking in, slipping it to you on an encrypted flash drive, and it was not hard to find a lawyer eager to take the case. Your boss had been more than willing to arbitrate and settle outside of court - your counselor, Harvey Bergmann, walked away with a tidy fee, and you climbed the stairs quite literally to your own brand new office, a plump deposit in your bank account and a yearly salary that had climbed into the six-digit range.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:As a child you boiled drinking water to kill parasites. You used a notebook because your dad couldn't afford toilet paper. Now, Anastasia, you sleep under 5,000 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets, you drink Chateau Alfred Rothschilde Red and you have the most luxuriant toilet paper in the City.
You:You have to bring up the toilet paper every time, don't you. Listen, I endured years - hear me, YEARS - of loose leaf in the name of hygiene, I worked hard to get a break.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:There's no denying that, not at all...and even if your job is questionable -
You:Someone's gonna do it if I don't -
The Devil on Your Shoulder:- you don't cause harm. You donate to reputable charities. You play Gin Rummy on Sundays with Old Miss Barnaby. You and your boyfriend hook homeless people up with hygiene products, charging equipment, hot meals...many are those who have done and behave worse.
Your boyfriend.
That's what he was, right? Tiberius wasn'treallyyour boyfriend, not that Aram minded you having your thing with him since Aram had his own fun on the side, and this never bothered you.
Many are the good things that have finally come into your life, and seemingly with no strings attached; things were surprisingly simple in their own way, because nobody was ever hurt. You think about the last date you went on with Tiberius -
-slinking your arm through his as you walk at his side, distracted from the Tibetan Cultural Exhibit at the Vortigern Field Museum by his sheer sex appeal. Five seconds of every six your eyes are tracing over the impression of his delicious physique underneath the silver collared shirt he wore, not a single smooth thread out of place when you drew your touch lightly down his ribcage...that every sixth second your attention was drawn to a three-century old Mandala, or an ornate saber in its gilded scabbard. He seemed to expound upon all of it with confident depth and knowledge. Nothing to you was more appealing than the ostentation of a mind rich with wisdom, which only enhanced his desirable physical presence. You're standing, gazing upward in quiet awe with brightly flushed cheeks as he effortlessly rattles off a history of the obscure Cham-Phrong Monastery's brave stand against the very Communists you'd been selling financial products to...his hand had drifted down your back to rest upon your ass, a daringly public display of possessiveness that made your thighs rub together with need. It was why, on the elevator ride down to the Neolithic Glory Display in the basement, you'd pushed him against a wall and kissed him, reaching a hand down to feel the hardening girth of his manhood.
The date would have been exciting enough had the intimacy and passion ended on that note, but like magnets of opposing polarity, you were drawn inevitably to make as intimate contact as possible. From the highest peak of intellect and class, down to the seedy nadir of lust -
- where he railed your sopping-wet sex, your fingers clenching the edge of the sink. Nobody on the third floor of the museum had noticed as you both disappeared into the elegantly appointed staff restroom you'd found unlocked. While you'd certainly noticed the red-and-gold striped wallpaper and the soft-glow of an antique French lamp, further details eluded you as each thrust of his cock scattered your attention like billiard balls. Skirt hiked up, panties slid to the side, your tongue lashed out instinctively across his index finger as his ring-glittering hand slid up your winsome throat to your lips. You sucked it lewdly into your mouth to give you something to moan around when your climax came at his attentive touch to your throbbing node. He's smirking at you with triumph in the mirror as your thighs shudder, your muscles contract around his manhood and your nectars splash across the haft of his cock. Your red painted nails scrape across the soapstone of the sink, and when the storming rush of your orgasm has run its course your own hand crawls down between your legs, feeling the diaphanous flesh of your labia spread around his dripping haft; you find his low-slung testicles, running your tongue with a grin over your lips as you massage them in your palm, coaxing his tempo ever closer to fill you with his ejaculation...
You loved his company - from his comet-quick wit to his fulfilling rut. He lives rent-free in your mind, but it is Aram who dwells in the temple of your heart. You'd not let anyone past those shuttered gates for years but he'd honored you with the sort of affection and love you'd always dreamed of. Like a rebel Prince Charming flying a black flag, he'd swept you off your feet to carry you off on his steed - only instead of a horse he rode a YZ250F. It was the first time you'd ever been on a motorcycle, and the first time you'd ever gone to a psytrance concert - you hadn't even known such a thing existed. Out there, miles from the city, the serene quiet -
- was broken by the rhythmic thud of hammering bass and melodic trebles. There were easily a few hundred people out here in the grassy hill-land just south of Granger Bayeux, most of whom seemed to already know Aram from a range of raucous parties and, of course, a storied career of running with politically subversive groups. The firelight cast a glittering shine across your tanned skin, perspiration dusting your neck down to the curve of your breasts in the black bikini top you sported; Aram made no secret of his carnal attraction to you, his touch brushing over your hips and ass in those high-cut camo-green shorts. You sat on his lap, kicking it with some of his friends from college around a sculpture made of interwired lava lamps, passing the hours with scandalous tales and impromptu song - a joint passed around the circle loosened your inhibitions and when night fell you were dancing with that Latin seduction only a girl like you could pull off. The lustful gazes of men and women alike crawled over you like sunlight through clouds, but you only had eyes for Aram. He'd forsaken his shirt hours ago against the humid Summer haze, and the muscle-cuirass of his chest...the handsome outline of his face in the bonfire's glow with that special smile, just for you...and of course, the alluring bulge under the fly of his jeans, they tossed what was left of your propriety into the swamp.
It had been the best party you'd ever attended - not because of the music or the drugs particularly, but it was Aram's company. You fell into each other's patterns, like years-long best friends; he had the same outrageous, irreverent sense of humor you'd once worked to hide from others' easily-ruffled sensibilities. You'd even read the same dark, angsty fantasy novels as high schoolers, and later the same equally tenebrous erotica. It made you insanely hot for him, and more than that, you could tell him -
" - I love you, I fucking love you baby," words hissed against the night's quiet as you bit down on his earlobe. With rain sprinkling softly on the tent's canvas mantle, his sleeping bag rumpled beneath you, you spread your legs lewd and wide, holding on to his hips and guiding him to your core. As had become your ritual, slick and hot with his first orgasm tingling within you, he vigorously fucked his seed deeper. As you'd discovered, his cock just happened to hit all the most -AMAZING- places in your vagina, points of pleasure you hadn't even known existed until he'd pressed his cum against them; the aching stretch danced perfectly along the line of pleasure just before pain, and he was the perfect length to simply...pound you. "I fucking love you too," he growled against your lips - it was by no means the first time he'd told you, but it was the first time (and not the last) he'd said those words while others heard you mating. In other tents, even outside your own, you could hear concert-goers engaging in their own carnal activities, initiated by your shameless desire to show them how well Aram could give it to you. You just...couldn't deny it: each one of your climaxes was more powerful with the knowledge that you'd inspired others. His second release within you was prompted by your kiss, a long-held note of release trumpeting from your throat and his with each spurting gush of his cum in your pussy.
Again...perhaps not the most traditional arrangement but you were hardly a traditional woman. You were a woman who'd overcome the sort of adversity that would break even the most steel-spined, and you'd finally been given what you truly wanted...a loving, wild romance, open and fun and incredible.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:And here we are...you, my darling, are truly ambitious.
You:Do you think I can pull this off?
The Devil on Your Shoulder:You certainly dressed to kill...how could they say no?
You:Oh I can think of many, many ways this could go wrong; what if -this- is where that male jealousy kicks in? What if they say yes and one of them chickens out, or like...they feel envious? Remember that story we read about the guy who pulled a gun cuz the other dude had a bigger dick?
The Devil on Your Shoulder:That's not the case here though, and you know that. Both of them have amazing dicks.
As was usually the case, the Devil whose advice had brought you nothing but happiness and advancement was right on all fronts. You were most certainly dressed to kill. After much fretting and struggling with details, as was your wont, you'd chosen a shiny blouse of sparkling gold; it shimmered brightly in the low club-lighting, unbuttoned to coyly reveal the gentle valley of your cleavage and the fringe of a lace-edged, black brazier underneath. It flattered your chest, drawing attention to the round firmness of your bust which both Tiberius and Aram enjoyed to your delight. Tucked into a black silk skirt, cut at the middle of your toned thighs, the sheer audacity of what you were going to try and accomplish tonight caused your lower belly to flutter, a flush of warmth rolling through your sex.
Underneath it all...a daring little thong awaited, one Tiberius was particularly fond of as it was so easy to shift to the side to take him. Gold, strappy heels were your shoe of choice tonight, and in the glorious ensemble of your outfit you knew were you getting looks from the well-dressed staff of Raulfo's.
You check your cellphone...almost time.
This could prove to be the best night of your life, or a complete disaster; you'd had a pretty damn good streak of success so far, however...
Meanwhile, in the lobby of the Hallesoff Building
57...58...59.
"Showtime," he muttered, sliding his smartphone in his pocket and checking himself once moer in the reflective windows of the lobby; easier to see details when a truck went growling by, and nighttime was when the vast majority crawled through The City's jammed streets to make their journeys out of Pomdufond County and up the Green Highway. They had schedules to keep that got tighter every year as the Teamsters became increasingly sclerotic and corrupt under their moldering leadership...but Aram had been finding such things harder and harder to care about.
That happened sometimes, when you met a girl that you were really into, all those things that sustained you through the liminal space of being single...not that he'd ever really lacked for sex. It'd become a predictable way to pass the time rather than passion shared with someone he cared about, though - until the girl of his dreams groped his cock on public transit. The temptress in question was waiting for him up there, and he always showed up just a bit early to the scene...he wondered what she was wearing; a woman's clothing was never something he'd particularly valued, but Anastasia was a being of artful physicality. Everything she did, from her silken saunter to the way she hiked her skirt up her thigh in invitation, with a display of whatever confection was clinging to her lush ass, seemed subconsciously choreographed.
As a bonus, she was always timely for their dates and moved quickly as a matter of course on those long legs, smooth like satin.
No easy feat down here in the South where everyone operated either on 'Iberian time' as he called it. That meant one needed to pad appointments with at least fifteen to thirty minutes. The fact that Anastasia was never late for him stood out...it warmed him in a way that was different from the caustic outrage-heat that usually suffused him. So he tried his best to look nice for her, using his limited funds (professional rabble-rousers didn't rake it in like business analysts or financial advisors) to get his hands on some decent threads.
At least, he thought they were decent, and she probably would too. Right? Truth be told, when it came to clothes and his personal appearance Aram often winged it because he hadn't had the luxury to pay attention, nor had anyone ever expected it of him...expectations had been low all his life, but again that changed with her.
It was why once shaggy black hair worn in disarray was clipped close and lightly gelled (with just a hint of affected mess); vintage band-wear and self-designed shirts proclaiming his latest rebellion were rather yesteryear, and tonight was the night of long sleeves and black, silver trim - he'd never been able to go fully-prep and formal, always a hint of punk in his chain-bracelet and studded belt. Second-hand jeans sat in a drawer at home for more than two months, and though he hadn't exactly grown accustomed to the way those wine-colored slacks Anastasia liked outlined her 'favorite parts', he had to admit they had a certain appeal.
Aram desperately wanted to look good for her. He'd never been this thoroughly attracted to a woman, maybe the first time he'd ever really known 'love' in his relatively few years - it had taken until the third date for her to admit that she was three years his elder, and in the back of his mind was this grinding unease that she would grow bored of him. He feared that he'd become little more to her than a callow plaything to pass the time. Anastasia was a creature of voracious sexual desire and incredible potency, and he knew that he wasn't the only man to grace her bed but...she assured him that he was her favorite, that she never used the 'L' word with any of them.
Raulfo's - really this whole part of town - was a bit high-class for his wallet, and he felt like a seagull among a flock of peacocks, pheasants, and birds of paradise.
This building kind of reminded him of this one club at the very top of the Sears Tower he'd gone to with a buddy. Where that place had been tacky and chaotic in its design, Raulfo's stuck loyally to its Meso-American Aristo chic, gold-leaf and Aztec codices layered over post-modern geometries. Checking himself in the reflective door of the elevator, he adjusted his belt and straightened his shirt before climbing in - holding the door open for another gentleman.
Aram leaned back against the wall, checking his phone simultaneously with his fellow passenger. Nowthisguy looked could fit in effortlessly in a place like this; he'd never been into the same sex, but even he recognized a good looking man. Punching down the sneering face of insecurity like one of those Patriot Front shit heads, he took a moment to analyze him.
He wore a crimson, gold-trimmed blazer open, casual over a green formal shirt tucked into red slacks; his pate was smooth-shaved, teak-dark and shining in the acerbic elevator lighting. The edge of a raptor's smile hinted at a razored intellect, eyes glinting devilishly behind silver, square frames.. Okay...this guy was definitely a lot more handsome than he was, and richer to boot; there came the gap-toothed grin of insecurity, reminding him that he was datingwayoutside of his league.
Thank god he didn't have to compete with him.
Aram pulled his phone out, glancing through a gameboard update for his favorite PC shooter when he noticed his companion's eyeglasses-reflection in the screen.
"You play Honorless?" the other man queried in a smoky baritone that sounded fit for board-rooms, big-tech exhibitions and TV cameras...friendly at least. Didn't even mind him peeking at his phone screen.
"I do in fact - I run with Clans, you?" Aram immediately began to like him when he gave a dramatic cringe and tsk.
"Harbormen...you don't strike me like one of those proles who plays Clans."
The two chuckled and shot the shit for the minute or so the painfully-slow elevator took to crawl up the fifteen floors to Raulfo's. Aram gave him a friendly fist-tap and made for the elevator door...at the same time as his companion. "Funny, you don't strike me as one of those proles who comes to Raulfo's."
"Hell you talkin' 'bout, this place is far too classy for someone like me," suitcoat quipped as they walked in together, side by side...thiswasa popular date-spot from what Aram had read, he was probably here to meet someone at his level of bouge.
Of course, all of his attention for his fellow elevator passenger was drawn away when he laid eyes onher. It was like a spotlight was beaming down on where she reclined upon a purple sofa, before a low-set glass table whose legs resembled little stone dogs, carved in Mayan style. Speaking of legs...hers were crossed loosely one over the other, shapely and polish-bright beneath that short black skirt of hers. His eyes traced all the way up to her thighs, wonder what she was wearing underneath. His heart throbbed at the sight of her round, firm breasts under that golden blouse - hers were especially fine, as he'd discovered that first time with her naked underneath the glass-dome ceiling of the botanical garden.
She spotted him, giving him a smile that was his and his alone - was she...looking off to the side...? No...all for him. Drawn in to the gravity well of her charm, Aram gave her his token cockeyed smile, already feeling a shuddering throb in his loins in anticipation of theincrediblesex they'd no doubt have when they went back to his place or hers - although...when he looked to his left, there was his elevator companion, still walking at his side.
Toward her. Unmistakable.
They stopped on the other side of the table, each one a mirror of the other's incredulity.
"You uh...lost there buddy?" Aram inquired, his voice a couple notes less friendly than before, an edge to his smile; he didn't like the flush of jealous possessiveness he felt over her - ridiculous, it wasn't like they were in a closed relationship anyway, it's just...tonight was kind of special.
"No I'm pretty damn sure of where I'm going, I think it's you who's wandering." The other man's response caught him off guard, and although Aram's first visceral desire was to commit violence he remembered whose eyes were watching him with quiet amusement. That and the fact that they were in a place where a casual brawl would probably be looked upon less than favorably.
"Uh. I get itpal, she's beautiful but like...you're kinda cutting in onmydate. Yours is somewhere around here, probably wouldn't like seeing you approaching mine." He turned to face him full on, crossing his formidable arms over his chest, no longer smiling.
"Mine is right here, I don't make that kind of mistake." He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose. "How 'bout you run along? Three's a crowd - "
The two of them broke into a controlled, cool back-and-forth.
" - don't really take kindly to your intrusionpal. I don't have anything against you but I'm starting to - "
" - really prefer to deal with this like civilized men, with you going your way and me not dragging you outside by your ear - "
" - you wouldn't know how to handle a woman like her, step back down to your league - "
They both trailed off when they heard Anastasia giggling quietly behind an elegantly manicured hand, reaching down to gracefully tip a martini against her rouge-tinted lips. Her skilled tongue crept out furtively under the swell of her lips to catch a drop of alcohol. Holding the moment gravid with anticipation, she swirled the drink in its gaudy pink cup and gave a coy motion for them to approach. "I have to apologize for not being forthcoming about all of this, but I honestly do think it is better this way...neither of you came into this with preconceived notions."
The two of them approached with only the barest modicum of hesitation, as not to appear timid before the other or the object of their affections, seating themselves in the chair across from her. Aram found her smile to be a fresh new thing, always sweet but now with the smirk of the one pulling the marionettes' strings. "Aram, meet Tiberius. Tiberius, this is Aram. Gentlemen, I have a proposition for you..."
*In the Heat of the Night...*
**The Devil on Your Shoulder**: *Oh Anastasia, how the garden of your victory grows ever more verdant...you, my grand success, the one who actually listened. Not all of us are so lucky as to be regarded as more than the base mumblings of a person's Id.*
**You**: *I'm sorry that I ignored you for so long...even more sorry to myself. What if I'd listened to you earlier? Would I have avoided all those bad things that happened to me?*
**The Devil on Your Shoulder**: *You did listen to me, only back then it wasn't about slaking your thirsts, you know it was about survival on those humid streets.*
**You**: *How do you figure?*
**The Devil on Your Shoulder**: *Ask yourself...when you were young, what was their great complaint about you?*
**You**: *That I never listened; it's not that I didn't listen, I did.*
**The Devil on Your Shoulder**: *And that's why you didn't obey. You know the least successful people give the most advice, the unhappiest souls extol the virtue of their lives and, you remember what they called those who didn't live as they.*
Whore. Ingrate.
**You**: *...and here we are now.*
The night's progression had been dreamlike, but far too lucid to be a dirty phantasm of your lust-soaked mind; where once such dalliances were relegated to the deep darkness of your secret thoughts, entertained only by the collection of toys you kept in your nightstand and lonesome calls to lovers who'd never grace your bed, it was as if your heart's fantasies were coming true. Trying to bring along two men, both of whom you were fucking - sometimes both in the same day - into comity was a gamble, but one that was amazingly well-informed.
After the initial shows of aggression and possessiveness (which you had to admit, you'd enjoyed immensely) had subsided, once wine had darkened glasses in the classy, low-lit cool of Raulfo's, they seemed naturally predisposed to friendship. They sometimes seemed more interested in whatever silly (and tempting) live-service shooter they played than you, though their attention always circled back around to the auric outline of your breasts, or the smooth tautness of your thighs...especially when you touched them both upon joining you at the couch.
Better, of course, was when the lighting dimmed, steam rose from vents in the floor shaped like the mouths of Mayan deities, and they *both* invited you to join them on the dance floor. For all their outward differences - Aram, hard-edged and ungovernable as Sparticus' *sica*; Tiberius, smooth and debonair as Preston Burke's scalpel - they collaborated toward your delight like sections of an orchestra. They *really* knew how to dance, and especially how to dance with you between them. Their hands running without shame over your tight, strong figure, the grind of their hips against your pelvis, your ass, and of course the heat of their breath and the hardness of their teeth against your neck...it all drove you *wild*.
Your body practically *howled* to take them back to your place, strip off your clothes, and let them ravage you but...you were an elegant creature of sophistication, not just some drunk college student eager to have a trained pulled on her.
That's why you all ended up taking a Bolt back to your well-appointed, fastidiously cleaned (for this occasion) flat. You were seated between their masculine heat on an incredibly high quality couch you'd liberated from a Salvation Army store for under $50, and under the dreamlike, cerulean lighting you'd installed all on your own, you sipped *Armand de Brignac* from a fluted glass as elegant as you. The unspoken inevitability flickered between the three of you, charged and tantalizing as an oncoming storm, but the reins of control rested in your palm since they accepted your proposal - a master closer of deals, as the Devil had pointed out.
The flatscreen, 74" Samsung pinned to your wall communicated your intent with a characteristic union of subtlety and a blatant pronouncement of your desires; Berolucci's *Dreamers* was one of your favorites since you were a university freshman, and the forbidden, triangular romance between Matthew, Théo and Isabelle had been the subject of more than one erotic fantasy on your part; now, here it was, coming true. Throughout the movie you found yourself fighting the carnal temptation of their physiques, both so different yet equally delectable, on either side - for the most part you remained civil but were unable to keep from having an occasional taste...your fingers, dragging up the Armani-smoothness of Thaddeus' leg, idly reaching out to squeeze the rock-hardness of Aram's shoulder; they did their own share of light groping, but their control is impressive as they eschew your firm bust and steamy-hot sex to trail hands along the inside of your thighs, over the flatness of your trim belly...somehow that excites you all the more.
Your nipples are hardened like diamonds beneath your bra, your clitoris throbbing against the silk of your panties...you're so soaking wet they could probably enter you without foreplay, and lurid imagery of them taking turns with you twists up from the murky corners of your mind.
It is during the bathtub scene that you take the chance - all three of them, relaxing together in the sudsy water...suspiciously not partaking of each other's flesh, though you had a different artistic vision in mind. You pause the film, smiling your Harlequin's smile at the both of them, and run your palms along the obvious, bar-stiff hardness pushing for freedom beneath their clothes; the curve of their shafts, the warm solidity of their crowns...they're ready for you.
"Gentlemen, shall we take a bath?" you suggest as casual as calico, pulling away from their touch (reluctantly) and trailing backwards toward your bathroom, slowly unbuttoning the gold of your blouse.
In the warm, slippery embrace of the water you settle between them both, chuckling quietly as Jimi Hendrix purrs from a little egg-shaped speaker mounted above the tub. Your descent into debauchery is a slow, easy fall, replete with the low thrum of the music and the sweet pungency of a joint you pass between them. "Not what I imagined myself doing on a Saturday night," Aram admitted with a smoky drawl as you reclined backward in his arms, your legs settled over Tiberius' lap; his fingers were at work draining all sense of tension from your body as he massaged your calves, gently squeezed your heels...
"And what *did* you imagine yourself doing, my handsome one?" you query, an arm ringing around his neck gently to stroke your soapy fingers through his hair. His features are thrown into shadowed relief in the flickering, low light - you'd thrown down on wall-mounted lanterns with those flickering lightbulbs that imitated lamp-flame, casting fanciful shadows across the deep, near-maroon red of your walls.
"Well...probably the same thing Tiberius imagined he'd be doing," your man answers coyly, running his thumb under the swell of your bottom lip. You nip gently at it, cheeks flushing hot and pink.
"Which was...something like this," the IT technician leans forward and circles his tongue in a blazing, tingling trail around the dark anther of your nipple, and you are unable to suppress the low groan that escapes your lips unbidden against Aram's thumb; your body becomes a semi-liquid thing, malleable yet taut as he brings his lips to yours. It's happening...it's really happening, going perfectly.
**The Devil on Your Shoulder**: *And now, Anastasia, is the chance to indulge that fantasy you've always entertained but never actualized.*
**You**: *Fffuck...you mean...?*
**The Devil on Your Shoulder**: *You know what I mean.*
Of course you do; it was something that passed through your mind more often than not.
"Tiberius...Aram...I want to please you both. Please..." you motion to the edge of your tub, shaped for easy reclining and...this moment in particular.
It's better than anything your imagination, perverse and detailed as it as, could have cooked up in the highest of definition; the water laps at your breasts as you marvel at the both of them. Seated as they are on the edge of your ostentatious bath, your hands stroke up and down the soap-slicked pillars of their cocks, admiring each in turn. They're both that perfect length and girth, and the way they touch you - sweet, soft caresses of your cheek and jawline a perfect accompaniment to the way they fondle and lightly tug your hardened nipples - drives you to lean forward and close your lips around Tiberius' glans. You swirl your tongue around the ridge of his crown, teasing under his foreskin and provoking the salty richness of his precum as you stoke Aram's hardness. Their words...the voices of two men you lusted for, praising your skill is part of the dream.
"Fuck that's good...don't stop, not for a bit at least..."
"This excites you, doesn't it - pleasuring both the men you've been fucking, right?"
"Gimme some of that..."
Your lips seal around Tiberius' cockhead, taking him deep into your mouth and uttering a low hum of desire before you pull away with a messy slurp, your tongue sliding like a shameless pink thing over your lips as you turn to Aram and start at the base of his cock. Your kiss and suck all the way up the curve of his shaft, sucking him down from his cut head and enjoying the distinction in their potent flavor; bobbing your head up and down your man's penis, a plaintive moan thrums in your throat at the way they squeeze your breasts, just a bit more insistently. This is driving you mad...if one of your hands was free it would working frantically between your thighs at your clit; but you know...something better is in store for you.
"Anastasia...would you like us to take turns with you?"
You're honestly not sure which of your men suggested it, but with your mouth still working the haft of Aram's lance you look up at them with plaintive eyes and give an eager nod. Rising carefully, vision swimming lightly from the cannabis' dulcet effect on your mind, you turn to present your round posterior to your man, looking over your shoulder at him with a coquettish little smirk. "You can't cum yet...and you," you turn your gaze up to Tiberius as he rises, settling in Aram's lap, "please...I want you to fuck my mouth with that big, beautiful cock of yours. Can you both do this for me?"
Ohhh how you adore the answer.
It's always a bit of work - the extremely pleasant kind - taking Aram's swollen glans, and you appreciate his patience as your hips move in that circular, feminine motion to enjoy the way he slides through your vulva. His free hand works his fingers against your pearl, his teeth at your shoulder as your hands snake around to take hold of Tiberius' firm posterior, guiding him into your mouth. You close your eyes and simply enjoy the ride, giving in to their masculine presence as one of them works his dark, turgid shaft into your hungry, sucking lips. He does, indeed, fuck your mouth, as if making love to it, guiding you gently over his shaft...it's incredibly dominant in its own way, but there's nothing degrading about this experience; on the contrary, you feel an incredible sense of control and power over your own destiny, the ability to take what you *want* when Aram finally enters you.
To your surprise - and his, no doubt - you're so turned on that you feel a throb of excitement run from the fore of your sex, lightning-sparks through your clitoris and up to your nipples as orgasm threatens to overtake you. You take Tiberius deep, finding comfort in the way his cock fills your mouth, reaching down to guide Aram's cock deeper inside of you; as you'd predicted, you're so aroused that he is able to bottom out all those inches in just four thrusts.
"Mmmm...oh Ana, you're incredibly wet tonight, and I know it's not from his cum this time - that's all you, isn't it baby." He punctuates his point when you feel the head of his cock make contact with your deepest place, guiding you onto the plateau before release.
You nod - or try to at least - before pulling Tiberius' manhood free and gasping as you ring both hands around him, pumping eagerly. "*Yes, yes god fffuck yes*, It's really good...oh Aram don't sto-mmmmmm...!" you trail off as you take your other lover's testicles, low-slung and churning, into your mouth, sucking on them and adoring the hint of his musk. Your plaintive moans crescendo as you ride the thermal of your oncoming climax, thighs shaking, your hips bucking at the way Aram stretches you open with that percussive pleasure-ache against your fundament. Colors flash before your eyes, a nova of sensation blossoming within you as that electric current conducts itself like lewd poetry through your body - everything, the lavender-scented bathwater and the flavor of Tiberius' precum, the feel of their hands pawing insistently at your breasts, the fingers working your clitoris overwhelm you with ecstasy.
It's better than any orgasm you've ever had, even better than the third time Aram made you cum in that one session that left you nearly comatose and giggling dreamily. Your vaginal muscles contract so hard around his shaft you actually squeeze him out, and you reaching a shaking hand down to thrust him back in, riding him to completion before falling forward against Tiberius. All of you laugh good-naturedly - "one for me!" Aram declares cheekily before you push Tiberius to recline backward and mount him. The subtle differences in their cocks mold against the silken grasp of your pussy as you take him inside of you, hands on his strong, wiry shoulders; behind you, Aram kisses your neck, nibbling his way up your jaw and nipping your earlobe as his hands find your hips...both of them holding your waist like that, it drives you wild.
"I think I know what she's really looking forward to," Aram muses - you're incredibly aware of the hardness of his penis, inches from your filled, soaked sex guided up and down Tiberius' lance.
"I think I do too." Before you can get a word in your breath is stolen by the way Tiberius takes your nipple in his mouth, and you pull his head closer to you to sink into his skill.
"Do you want us both inside of you?" your boyfriend whispers against the ridge of your ear, a sheepish, excited grin spreading across your face as you take Tiberius down to his hilt, grinding and gyrating your hips to enjoy every inch of him.
"Both of us...fucking your pussy?"
You nod, short, rapid motions, briefly robbed of the power of language; higher thought is stolen in turn, giving you cause to grip the edge of the bathtub as Tiberius pulls free and Aram penetrates you from behind. They take turns with you, your body pressed between their muscular warmth as you slick your juices over the both of them; when Tiberius roots himself inside of you and brings his palm down to clap your ass, euphoric release springs from your lower belly and well-fucked sex unexpectedly again - "now we're tied," Tiberius declares.
"C...can we...please take this to my bed?" you manage to get out. Toweling off quickly, they lay you upon your back on your satin-soft, white comforter, the cool fabric sliding against your bared form as the two of them shower your body with attention. You writhe and open yourself to them, spreading your thighs with an eager sound between their lips touching yours...Aram's teeth on your neck, Tiberius tongue over your collarbone, and the twin white-fire of both of them sucking your nipples at the same time. Their skilled fingers find your wet, swollen sex, spreading your lips and toying with your little pearl as it throbs and pulses under their attentions.
Once again they take turns fucking you; Aram first, sliding easily into your offered pussy and shaking the bed with his thrusts. He's so *powerful*, the sinewed, statuesque carve of his shoulders perfect for you to hang on to as your headboard clatters against the wall, incredibly wet, lewd sounds punctuated by your keening moans; you feel your walls clench around his shaft, almost refusing to let him go as he pulls out - the sight of his broad glans, dripping your arousal and a trickle of his pre-cum sliding forth is *wildly* erotic...unbelievable is the imagery of Tiberius taking his place, pushing your knees against your shoulders as he sinks into you and drills deep against your core. Concussive, deep waves of heat echo through your lower belly, bucking your hips upward as he attends to your hardened node.
"Come on...both of you, I want you to give it to me. Please?" you coyly entreat, circling your grasp around Aram's manhood and looking up at him with a loose grin. "I've never had it before..."
"Only if you tell us in exacting detail what you want, Anastasia," Tiberius cajoles you - clearly enjoying making you squirm as he frots your swollen sex with the underside of his haft.
"I can't, it's too shameful!" you laugh, wrapping your lips around Aram's crown to give your mouth an excuse not to have to say it, even though part of you really enjoyed them teasing it out of you.
"Not at all...it's by telling us what you want that we're here," Aram points out with a smirk, but he's right. Humming softly against his balls, causing him to groan low and hungry, you stage-whisper the words against the base of his cock.
"I want you both inside of me...both in here," your fingers draw down and indicate your sopping wet pussy. "And I want you both to cum in me."
This is the part you've been waiting for eagerly...the coup-de-grace of your fantasy, the maraschino cherry drooling its sweet syrup on top. You push Aram to lie back against your pillows, kissing him deeply as you sink down upon him, taking his swollen length, sucking him into your warm, wet grasp and delighting in the way his hands reach around to take your hips, guiding your bucking hips before a palm claps on your ass, provoking an entirely whorish sound from your lips as he held your thighs apart. It would be a tight fit, and as you felt Tiberius slide his fingers up the backs of your thighs to your waist, you did all you could to relax yourself...hard with your boyfriend running his tongue in circles around your nipple.
It's far more arousing than you could have imagined, the sensation of both men working against your entrance, shameless of how their cocks made slippery contact. "Fuck, oh fuck yes, penetrate me...this is amazing," you laugh, slightly unhinged before your voice crescendos into a long aria of desire when the girth of their crowns slipped inside of you at the same time. "Don't...don't be gentle with me," and then they're both going at you.
The sensation of both their cocks railing you is singular, all sensation in your body concentrated on that incredible sense of being opened and filled, of the rhythmic way they alternated their thrusts. As if trying to batter down the gates to your fundament, they both fuck you roughly; the shadow of Tiberius laying his cock within you, the feel of Aram's shaft pressed *hard* against your G-spot rob you of coherent thought and speech. You lose track of your climaxes, coming in mini-bursts of nuclear warmth that build up toward what would be the hardest, most mind-blowing orgasm of your whole life. You arch your back, white spots flashing before your eyes; Tiberius' hands find your breasts, pulling you back against him. Aram's fingers work your clit in rapid circles...glutton for sensation that you are, you edge yourself along the release as long as you can before it overtakes you.
"You like being double penetrated?" Aram's voice is husky and harsh.
*YES! I DO! I FUCKING LOVE YOU BOTH FUCKING ME!*
Is what you would say if you were capable of speech. An iniquitous sound escapes your lips as you shudder and shake, and release a gush of sweet, hot nectars over the both of them. Both plunged within you to your core, up to their hafts, you reach around and kiss Tiberius with your chilled lips, panting and groaning obscenely. "Please...finish in me, I *need* it!"
They, of course, oblige you.
You switch positions, mounting Tiberius reverse cowgirl - his favorite, in fact - and displaying everything to Aram. Unable to resist the sight of your filled, swollen sex, he kneels between your legs and you reach down to guide him back inside, clenching down on the both of them and holding on to his shoulders through the ride. You feel it shortly thereafter, the swelling sensation that precedes a man's release; the turgidity of their shafts, the warmth of their precum flowing. "Nnngh...gonna cum...you want that?" Aram whispers against your neck.
"YES!"
"I am too," Tiberius hisses, guiding you up and down the shining, soaked length of his shaft.
"Yes fuck YES BOTH OF YOU CUM IN ME, *OH FUCK YEAH!*" you exult, throwing class and modesty to the winds of release.
The moment of their ejaculation, timed one shortly after the other, bastes your core memories; all of it...the smell of their cum, the sound of their deep, manly grunts of effort...the sight of Aram's stomach muscles tightening, and Tiberius' hands upon your hips; the taste of their sweat. He's first to release, ropes of his warm seed gushing against the entrance of your womb as Aram's cockhead slides up and down his shaft. Your boyfriend clenches his teeth, the sinew in his neck standing out in a way that is *wildly* sexy and you feel his cum shoot hard inside of you. The sound of their thrusts become wet percussions, a sticky slap that brings the fresh scent of their churning seed to your attention.
When they slowly pull forth from you, their fertile warmth dripping from your throbbing sex, they kiss the sweat from your body, praising your singular skill and insatiable desire for them both. Your body tenses, flickers of aftershock-lightning crawling from your warmth-flooded depths to your nipples to your lips when they kiss you. Involuntary moans in the heat of aftershock become low, satisfied chuckles shared between the three of you.
A round of drinks shared between the three of you, you crawled into bed beneath them - the capstone of your fantasy...the sensation of sleeping between the warm bodies of the men you desired was perfect, and although you wanted dearly to evade sleep that you might drink deeply of this moment, exhaustion finally claims you.
**The Devil on Your Shoulder**: *That was...incredible. Best sex I've ever had - best you've had too. Whenever you looked at porn -*
**You**: *What?! No don't tell me you were watching me look at porn -*
**The Devil on Your Shoulder**: *- I remember you often searched for...what was it?*
**You**: *No no no, you're far more than just a voice in my head you demon -*
**The Devil on Your Shoulder**: *- romantic double dickdown, hmh trio rico, one after the other -*
**You**: *- a nightmare, an absolute nightmare I tell you...fine, yes, yes I've thought this sort of thing was hot for a while, it's just so damn greedy. I honestly can't believe any of this worked out...how did I meet men like this?*
**The Devil on Your Shoulder**: *Look at them.*
You crane your head to the right and lay your eyes upon Tiberius. Through the open window, the interplay of brightly saturated light from billboards and all the neon nightlife dapples his skin. You realize how rarely you've gazed upon his face without glasses; he's so princely...even in his sleep he appears confident, the hint of a satisfied little smile at the corner of his lip. Tiberius wasn't exactly long-term boyfriend material, but your time with him had been deeply satisfying, both intellectually and sexually.
You shift your gaze to your left, and find yourself making eye-contact with Aram. As undeniably handsome as Tiberius is, your boyfriend is simply...stunning, in your eyes, singularly beautiful in a way you'd never really seen before. Before you can speak he shifts closer to you, pressing his lips softly at first against your own - you receive him eagerly, and soon you are kissing him with fierce quiet. He's passion and teeth, nipping your lip, nails dragging up your ribcage to squeeze your breast, eagerly pressing the steel-hardness of his erect cock against your thigh.
It's strange how you're trying to be quiet, as if you don't want to wake Tiberius - surely the way Aram climbs atop you, how you spread your legs widely for him, hands on his shoulders - will awaken him. In the comparative dark of your room you can see the rock-hard length of your man's penis silhouetted against your inner leg; you reach down to maneuver him into your sex, a plaintive moan as he slides in with barely any effort. Their cum is still warm inside of you, a wet noise of displacement as Aram's penis presses it deeper into your vagina, up against your womb. Even as you contain your voice, head back against the pillow and covering your eyes with your arm, the thrust of his cock and the upward rock of your hips shakes your bed...it isn't a surprise to feel Tiberius' hand find your breast, trailing down to pluck at your clitoris.
This, of course, draws a shameless sound from your lips, guttural and unladylike.
Aram pulls out, dripping with your cream and his, wordlessly making way for Tiberius. You eagerly welcome him between your thighs, sliding his foreskin back to rub the tip of his manhood against your vulva, gathering their seed before he slides inside of you. Your eyes open widely, waking your neighbors with your cries as Aram pleases your breasts with his mouth. Caught once again in the maelstrom of their lovemaking, you give in, nearly delirious with pleasure as they take turns pounding you.
On your knees, hands gripping your headboard, your voice breaking with need as shockwaves of ecstasy rock upward through your body, as if they're competing to see who can rail you the hardest. So far it's a tie, one you encourage by attending to the other with your mouth when his companion is mating your pussy.
You mount Tiberius, rocking your hips back and forth with hungry alacrity, stroking over his length filling you - you throw yourself back against Aram when Tiberius pulls free, alternating between your lovers. You work a second orgasm from Tiberius, driven to frenzy by their hands on your waist and hips as you fuck every last drop of semen from him.
You roll off your lover, onto your back as Tiberius rises with a stretch and makes for the bathroom...looking to Aram, kneeling mast-hard and ready. "You want a fourth load babe?" he teases you, and you nod with an eager laugh. Ringing your legs around Aram's waist, you meet his thrusts with bucking hips and breathy groans; you're body is absolutely attuned, ringing like a wire carrying an electrical current. The volume and potency of their ejaculations adds a new, incredible heat to the experience of fucking them both, but you realize...you're glad it's Aram finishing you off for the night.
It was his seed you wanted to claim you, for other men to know you as *his*; you simply didn't feel that for Tiberius, but for Aram...
You pull him in for a kiss, one that is surprisingly romantic given the fact that you've been getting bareback drilled by both of them. "Ana..." he whispers against your chin. "I've never met anyone like you, and I know I never will."
What is this?
Your heart swells, and you hold his face in your palms gently. "Really?"
"Yes, and even though we do this kind of thing...can you still be mine?" he asks, almost vulnerable, even as he drives you powerfully against the mattress.
Your man. Your boyfriend. Maybe someday in the future, something even more...something better.
