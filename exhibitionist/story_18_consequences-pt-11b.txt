David
From Part A:They are at the reunion and David has been joined at his table by Abby, a temporary teacher who is helping out for the night. Her husband is away working for an unknown period in the UK. They have a relationship based on 'what the eyes don't see the heart doesn't worry about.' Meanwhile Olivia is circulating and has not recognised good looking Bill who was in the same year at School, but they get talking.
"You must miss your husband," I say to Abby, whilst at the same time noticing a man standing beside Olivia looking across at me. I decide to give them a wave which distracts my company. "Sorry," I just noticed we were being watched so I waved to them."
"Someone you know?"
"Yes my ex, I said I would escort her for the weekend, keep an eye on her, we are partly here to resolve some hidden bad memories she has of the time before she left." I said in a resigned voice.
"By the tone of your voice you're not actually here by choice. Is it what caused you two to break up?"
"There is no quick easy answer to those questions, I didn't want to come, that's for sure, but your company is definitely making it easier."
"Why sir, you're a gentleman as well as handsome." she flirted, completely against her personal principles.
"Well thank you for the compliment and may I say too that you are also very hot."
"Thank you, but I think you are trying to avoid the question."
"She has a problem that the specialists think was first established by something that happened in her early life, and then triggered by something that happened more recently, but I know for a fact that it isn't as straightforward as that."
"Wow, it does sound complex, but I am intrigued so I have to ask, what part of that causes a marriage to fail?"
"Multiple infidelity."
"Ohh I see."
"Look around casually in a moment and you'll see a rather beautiful woman talking to a tall good looking guy with dark hair, they are standing almost diagonally opposite near the corner. There's two guys behind them who are looking daggers at him so I guess they thought they had a chance and he has stepped in, not her usual type though."
We stopped talking for a while and I lean back looking at my phone again and she pretends that I am engaged in something and is looking around the room.
"I see what you mean, and you think he or they have a chance with her?"
"I'd say so unless her usual type turns up or something else happens. Knowing her, she'll take a group home to our room, there's a couple of pretty women in that circle too.
She tried to look shocked but I saw more, there was intrigue and then I saw interest and I thought. 'ahh well, I wasn't looking anyway, odds are she will angle for an introduction.'
Abby was a patient woman. She didn't ask straight out although I was sure she was dying to ask, but eventually she asked if I would introduce her and I was very happy to do so. If she wasn't interested in me I'd rather pass her on and get back to my phone. I am going to find somewhere more private I thought. Abby took my arm as I led her across the room. 'Well played, Abby,' I thought, you're making Olivia think she has a connection to feed off. As graciously as I could, I introduced Abby to them and quietly slipped away avoiding anyone who tried to catch my eye.
Finding a private space proved difficult, so I grabbed a stool against the wall beside the bar that had been set up at one end of the room and was regularly surrounded by patrons. Most of the time there were people standing in front of me so I wasn't about to be bothered but was close enough to respond if Olivia pressed her emergency button. I would know soon enough if she sent me a message as I was holding the phone.
I did eventually get a message near the time I supposed the gathering was winding up for the night, saying 'A group of us are going back to our hotel and Bill's offered me a lift, we'll probably be in the bar. I'll try not to wake you when I come in.'
'Are you sure you don't want to go up first rather than wake me when you bring the party up?' was what I was now resigned to reply, then I changed my mind and fired off, 'I'm tired, I'll get another room.'
'Go to our bed ❤' was all she had time for.
So I sent back a final message saying there was a futon in our lounge, 'I'll pull it out, please use it.'
*******************************************************************************************
David's viewpoint
I couldn't wait to clamber into bed and I exited as quickly as I could with just one quick look back at Olivia to check that she wasn't under any pressure, not that that would have stopped her. She didn't turn as she usually did when I looked at her so I presumed my services were not needed further. 'Only a few days more' I told myself. I prepared the futon, then showered and was into bed as fast as I could manage it, for a well-deserved sleep.
I suppose I have gotten so used to being on duty for a late night tryst or an emergency rescue call, that when Olivia arrived home she woke me even though she was quiet. There was an interval for her to shower and I caught a fleeting view of her body silhouetted as she came out. Then I felt the other side of the bed settle and the cover tugged slightly. I could hear her breathing as she lay unmoving for a while then I felt her turn and shuffle towards me. She couldn't help herself whispering, "Can I have a cuddle please?" I couldn't help swearing quietly 'For fucks sake,' I thought, 'hard luck if I was asleep.' I relented and turned over and drew her into me, trying not to let my unrelenting sexual attraction for this woman over-ride my tiredness.
"I'm sorry," she whispered, waggling her shapely butt into my groin. I swore again under my breath and was sure I heard a little giggle. I tapped her hip as punishment so she pushed her hotness further, rubbing up and down my growing shaft. I heard a moan of recognition that she had achieved her goal and she reached around to position my hardness exactly where she wanted it. Apparently she needed no foreplay as she slipped me easily inside and began to make herself comfortable, for a long time she just played, wiggling her butt around or up and down then savouring the excitement it brought her, I could feel her fingers touch me from time to time as she caressed her clit; all the while my hand caressed her nipple and I kissed the back of her neck. Eventually after what seemed forever I heard her breath catch and she murmured, "I so miss making love with you," then she came with a cry and I speeded up to join her. I held her tight as the throbbing tingles went through me, then I drew out and pulled her body face-down on top of me. I revelled in the feel of her breasts squashed against my skin, her legs stroking for a while against mine as she still enjoyed the after effects. I laid her head on my chest as she always used to after we made love and my eyelids become heavy. Then I felt little droplets on my skin, she was crying and there were little movements of her chest as she tried to suppress her sobs. I closed my arms tightly around her and stroked her back and her hair.
I was woken to the delicious feeling of Olivia's tongue licking my lollipop and delighted in the feel of her mouth enclosing my uncontrollable part, the hot wetness closing around me as she tried to take me whole, something that was a lifetime ambition of hers. I looked down into her soft eyes that smiled as we met and she popped off to say "good morning sleepy head" then she rose up to take my 'morning wood' inside her pussy, closing her eyes and letting out a satisfied "ooooooooh". I now appreciated just how deep my wife's depth of desire went and the challenge that came with it. She rolled her hips back and forth rolling her clit and her aroused vulva against me and I lifted my hips to assist. She was beautiful and enticing to admire and my eyes drank her in before lifting my hands to her breasts to add more stimulation.
We made love, played, and caressed each other all morning until I was sure her immediate needs were satisfied at least for a while, she was like a force of nature driven to more and more sexual arousal. We caught brunch at a local café then we toured the entire area that she had frequented in her childhood and youth. She made a few faces as we entered some parts, presumably bad memories but didn't say much about them. "Let's take a walk by the river." She said with a smile, that I hoped reflected good memories. We grabbed a sandwich and a drink from a deli and found ourselves a quiet spot to watch the water and its inhabitants go by. I felt by her demeanour after we had left the built up area, that the river may have been significant once and in the end I asked out right. I was surprised to see a little extra colour as she admitted "I lost my virginity here."
"I wish it had been me," I responded. "What was it like?" And pulled her close to me to provide comfort if needed.
She looked at me and kissed me fervently. "It was two guys," she said, her eyes downcast, "I thought we were just going walking as we often did, but Frank took me in his arms and kissed me like never before. I could feel his hands roaming all over my body and I became excited then I felt Jamie's hands too, he was stroking my breasts and started taking my clothes off. They took me one then the other, neither of them lasted long and I remember feeling that I had missed something. Then this older guy came by and asked me if I was ok. I can't remember what was said but he helped me find out what I had missed because of the boy's innocence, it still makes me tingle to think of."
I just felt sad that her first time wasn't with someone she cared about.
Olivia and I made love there on the bank, it was slow and sensual and caring and she cried out with pleasure then told me "I love you David, you are my true heart, I wish I made it easy for you to love me back."
I did have a part of me that would always love her despite everything but she was gradually eroding my feelings. She had to get better soon or it would be too late for us. "Am I beyond redemption?" she asked, searching my face. All I could do was shake my head "History says so but every once in a while I have a little hope that there is something of my Olivia in there" and I touched where her heart should be. She threw herself at me kissing like crazy, I had given her hope but I wasn't sure that her devil would share Olivia's motives.
We went back to our room, not having achieved much except enjoying each other. I wasn't sure about her story of her first time. Was it relevant or just anecdotal? I might never know. We were having an early dinner in our room so we decided to get ourselves ready in plenty of time. I watched her sashay across the room and begin to undress, she did it slowly, sensually, almost carelessly and I knew she was horny again so I followed her after she went into the shower room, stripping my clothes off as I went. As I opened the door I saw her trademark turn and smile at me, enigmatic and subtly inviting. I went to her and dropped to my knees, then looked into her eyes, now hooded with desire, and giving me a look of assurance that I was doing what she needed. I drove my tongue in one long sweep from anus to clit and felt her shiver with pleasure and expectation. Then I worked my magic and with a knowing tongue and probing fingers, I quickly brought her to orgasm and then again as the waters washed away the remnants of our previous lovemaking.
"So," I said after we had finished together with Olivia leaning forward against the shower wall as I plundered her. Now we were sitting in our robes with our meal spread before us. "Who is going to be lucky tonight?"
"Well if you play your cards right," she teased.
I laughed out loud at her bravado, then ran my hand up the inside of her thigh.
"Are you sure you are up to what your hand suggests?" She teased.
I raised an eyebrow, not sure but willing to test her teasing, my fingers now getting very close to her hot centre. I felt her legs open, permission granted for entry. 'message received' I thought, as my fingertips found her clit.
Our meal over, I went to finish my ablutions and was not surprised as I came out to find Olivia laid back on the bed. Her head on the pillow, robe wide open as one hand fingered her pussy and the other groped her left breast. She heard me, gave a teasing smile, brought her knees up and wide, crooked a finger then licked her lips. The woman is insatiable, I thought, as I went to her, my tongue ready to do its duty again
"I think I would like that Abby just where you are now." She finally answered my question from earlier, "Maybe Bill can be next and then you can be the grand finale till morning," she teased.
"Until Morning?" I questioned.
"Ohh yes you three will have to keep trying until you get it right."
It was so naughty that I couldn't help laughing and realising that I wasn't offended, she laughed with me. "I don't know about that, I'd like to have that Abby for myself. No doubt there's a few more who will want to feel that hot pussy of yours." I jested.
She looked at me, checking that I wasn't unhappy or cross, so I responded. "It's ok you can have them to yourself. I'll keep out of the way." It wasn't what she wanted to hear but hey, I'm not that stupid.
**********************************************************************************************
Olivia's talks about the first night of the reunion
I liked Abby immediately, she was just my type too, for me she oozes sexuality although I sensed that the guys didn't pick up on it, perhaps because she spent so much time being indifferent to boys' attention at school. So we all ended up at the Hotel, the two men and two women from the group plus Abby, and Bill. I soon got the feeling that the evening wouldn't last much longer, there was an air of tiredness that I put down to journeys to get there. Or maybe I was just losing my touch. More likely I suspected that it was because they weren't used to multi-person sex and since they hadn't had a lot of alcohol, they didn't have the courage to try their hand. I sensed that Bill and Abbey were up for anything and I hoped the others would leave but no such luck and they all ended up leaving at the same time.
So, disappointed, I made my way to our bedroom to find David fast asleep but I was really naughty rubbing my bottom against his groin, giving him no choice, men are so led by their cocks. I could feel he was a little cross but how could he refuse what I was offering, why I messed around downstairs in the bar when I could be up here with David's hardness fulfilling my needs is beyond my own sense. My bad side needed to learn what was really good in the world. I slept better after I had had my way with David and then felt his arms close around me, something that I hadn't felt for a long time, it was so, so, comforting, and safe.
The next day was wonderful because it was just us, we talked and laughed together as we explored the place I had known so well and I did make him laugh when I admitted that I had told Abby he had ten other women back home. "Does he?" She said, "there is no chance for me then." I told her there probably was until she asked to meet me.
"Sorry David I probably ruined your chances." I apologised.
"No problem," he said. "My type always prefers other men or women." He looked at me so knowingly that my skin crawled like he had gotten inside me. It was as if he could read my mind and knew all my secrets. Something told me that I wasn't far from the truth and it undid my newfound optimism for a while.
It was a comfortable day otherwise and I found that I loved just being with him, then we walked along the river bank and we made love again, our lovemaking is so sweet and precious that I don't want it to end. I told him about my very first time right here, the edited version of course, and my man wrapped me in his arms and made me feel safe, and guilty that my demon was set on destroying this special relationship we had.
It was dance night and there would be alcohol, some people would be there who couldn't make it on Friday and there were still some I was hoping to meet again. Soon after our arrival I met up with Bill and Abby again and David disappeared somewhere, bless him. After the day we had I was sure that he really did just want me to enjoy myself, not lose me. He hadn't turned a hair at the jokey notion of me having the two of them through the night or had he just given up on me altogether? Something inside me still doubted and if it weren't for my demon I would know we were deeply in love after the last 24 hours, so why was I risking it.
Abby and I really connected without a bunch of guys hanging around and Bill kept close but let us ladies enjoy ourselves. We danced together, getting a little intimate but this wasn't the place for overly sensual action. We had a couple of drinks (I know I shouldn't) and I made her a naughty suggestion, "how would you like to make David's evening?"
"Really?" She said, "What naughty idea do you have in mind?"
"David loves girl on girl, want to come play with me and tease him?"
She looked at me considering, I knew I was jumping to conclusions. "What makes you think I'm into ladies?"
I quirked an eye at her and she had the good sense not to deny it. "I think you're one sexy woman who is into men and women just like me, you would love it at our home, come visit soon, but I can't wait to taste your pussy." I'd shocked her of course but she didn't hold back when I took her hand and led her out. We stopped for a moment and she watched me type, 'come soon, this one's for you'
"That will have him guessing," I said with a satisfied grin.
"You are a naughty girl," she said. "I like it, but I'm so glad you don't live here though."
"Why?" I said getting close to her in a dark recess.
"I think I might never get out of your bed," she murmured.
"Mmmm" I said, "I like the sound of that, you will come home with me tonight won't you, maybe tomorrow too?"
"I thought you would be going home tomorrow."
"I think I can still talk him around."
"I thought you weren't a couple anymore?"
"I can still talk him around if I need to, he still loves me really, despite what I've done to him."
"That's pretty nasty don't you think."
"Maybe, but he knows what I am up to, I don't get away with much he doesn't want me to." That was a lie of course and as my mind explored that thought, I realised that my assumptions were entirely based upon what my bad side would have me believe. Otherwise why would I have said that, when it was more a case of me not giving him any choice. My demon took over then as I stopped her thinking with a long kiss and began to probe my fingers inside her clothes. She was obviously desperate for me after waiting since yesterday, we played until David arrived and I said in a hushed urgent voice, "he's here." I loved the way the idea of being watched by him really turned her on, all of a sudden she was a tigress, her hands were everywhere, my blouse was suddenly open and my bra undone, then she was sucking my nipples. I was not going to be outdone and raced to keep up. Our panties came down in a rush of passion and her fingers couldn't wait to find my waiting, excited pussy and I moaned out loud as she entered me and began to stroke the parts we both knew and enjoyed. My fingers found her pussy too, she was ready for my probing, excited by the risqué scene we had created but I knew David wouldn't let anyone else near us. We were both ready and came quickly, our desire built up to breaking point. "Can we have him too?" she asked and her idea definitely worked for me, I crooked my fingers at him and saw him come out of the shadows.
Together, Abby and I paid homage to his body, I am sure we would have been happy to have continued throughout the night. We pleasured him together stroking, kissing, and sucking on him while our fingers continued to explore each other. I wanted to take this threesome to our bed but David reminded me we had a mission to fulfil and we went back in, knowing that we had unfinished business. "David, can we stay a day longer and take her into our bed for a long, long, session? I want her." He looked at me as he once did, wanting to please me, give me anything to make my life fun. My heart rose with a joy I had given up on as he replied. "I like the idea, let's spend the day in bed, the three of us."
I couldn't wait to tell her, I was so excited and her face looked as excited as mine. I felt like we were made for each other, I wanted her with us even though we had only just met.
The two guys I was hoping to meet came to the evening eventually, they were still local and hadn't stood the test of time as Bill had, they had their wives with them and I asked David to join me at their table. We talked about something that may have happened in the past but they were very reticent about it. Their wives seemed to be scrutinising them in a 'why haven't I been told about this,' way. Obviously they suspected that there had been another relationship they hadn't been told about. Eventually the men crumbled under pressure from their wives. "All we want to say is that Olivia's parents know about it, it's for them to say, not us." I turned to David and he had a look of confusion, this didn't sit well with him, it didn't sound right. He pushed them further asking for numbers he could contact them on and they couldn't find a reason to refuse, I saw him quickly input their names and phone numbers.
We parted and David headed for the bar saying he would meet me, but Bill intercepted me. "Have I upset you?" he asked.
"No of course not," I said there's just stuff going on that's nothing to do with you.
"I'll need a kiss for assurance of that," he said, trying his luck.
I directed him to where we had been earlier and sent David a message, "I am outside with Bill, rescue me in a while my darling." Then I tried my luck writing a follow up, 'May I have him later?'
"It conflicted me to type that, but I had such competing feelings, I wanted this man but I wanted my husband more and I really hoped David would understand. The message that came back made me doubt, it said "Why wait till later,? your Demon will do what it wants anyway."
David did rescue me, he was a bit late because Bill had already had his hands in naughty places and now I was enjoying his cock. We were both anxious and didn't delay, he had me leaning against the wall thrusting his generous handful into me very nicely; I always seem to be ready. But that wasn't a bad thing to delay, he would be even hungrier later. David stopped us by calling out for me, saying there was something urgent I needed to deal with. Bless him, I am going to do such a great job of waking him tomorrow morning; if I ever make it to sleep that is. I spoke to Bill, "will you take me to our room in a little while?" I could see the initial frustration and disappointment written across his face seep away at that.
David, my David, caught up with me in the hall, "Was that ok?" he asked.
I could have ravaged the man on the spot, he was way too good for a slut like me and my heart burst with love for him. I pulled myself together, we had an image to maintain of being an estranged couple. "Yes perfect, I've promised he can take me home, do you think you could be busy for a while?"
He actually smiled at that, I couldn't believe he was being so kind and my demon was definitely taking control. "Of course," he reassured. "Now take my phone, make out you're in a difficult call to home"
We rescued the drinks that David had bought while I had my unexpected tryst with Bill, I was still in awe of David's attitude to me and my excitement scale was through the roof. He led me to a table and we watched the people dancing. I kept my eye out for Abby making sure she would know where we were. Meanwhile my excitement level led my hands to wander along David's inner thigh, tentatively at first, he would know that I had moments earlier had my hands on another man. As that thought hit me I felt a wave of shame wash over me as if I was now a different person. "I'm so sorry David it must be awful for you that moments ago I was with someone else."
"Yep" was all he would say which I took as him holding his real feelings back.
"Shall I stop stroking your leg?"
He turned to look at me square in the face. "I don't think it's a good thing that I am becoming immune, I loved our day together but each little infidelity erodes something inside me. I know I could have stopped you earlier but does it matter anymore?" He finished his sentence as a rhetorical question.
"I do hope so. I thought today that we had a special connection, a feeling that only you and I share even if we love others."
"Maybe" he agreed, "I don't feel cross now, just pleased that you are here and safe. You don't have to stop your stroking, I've decided we could have a fun night if there are four of us. Is Abby coming?"
"She said she would, I asked her to be with us tomorrow too if you agree, she wants you David."
"You don't get out of your guilt with that one my girl, for that I am going to make her scream with pleasure right in front of you"
"You bad boy" I replied, lightly punching him on the arm with my free hand whilst my other hand found his crotch.
With about half an hour to go Bill found me and we quietly slipped out the door. David saw me and I gave him that look I used to get his ok, my whole self knew it was more important than anything. He gave me a naughty grin back and then reached to put an arm around Abby followed by kissing her cheek. She responded by smiling up at him with eyes full of promise. "Gorrer" I thought hypocritically.
I gave the poor man a torrid time on the way home, lightly scratching the inside of his thighs and running my hands up and down his arm. By the time he got me in the lift to the room he was desperate to get into my panties and I felt like a queen. He had me in his arms almost before the room door closed, trying to kiss me but something inside me stopped him, he could kiss anywhere but on the lips, today that was for David, weird huh? He got the message and concentrated on my neck until he had my clothes off then he threw me on the bed and stripped as I watched. I liked his body, it was tanned and muscled, I licked my lips in anticipation, he was probably too excited to be any good for round one but round two, yes round two should be good. Maybe if he lasted long enough I'd give David a little show, see if I could coax him into a threesome or Foursome. That thought shot a tingle all the way down to my clit so I decided to give Bill a treat and began to stroke my clit and mix in some fingering to get him even more excited. Could he be any more stretched I wondered.
As he dropped his pants, I slid forward to best admire his package, his cock stood tall and proud and I made things worse by running my tongue from its base to the tip, finishing off with a kiss and a suck. 'Mmmm' I thought, very nice. I could play with this one for hours, so I did for as long as he allowed. I sunk him to my throat then fucked him with my mouth, not too long though before I needed another play with my hands and tongue. I felt him twitch excitedly and decided to slow down, after all, I wanted David to see something of what he was missing. He pushed me back a little and dropped his head between my welcoming thighs. 'Good man,' I thought. 'Now show me how good that tongue is."
'Eight out of Ten,' I thought, as he finally slid his body along mine, 'definitely room for improvement with some teaching by a good woman.' He entered me slowly, my natural lubricants making it easy for him and my pussy walls expanded to make him welcome, he was hard and hot and I rubbed my clit against his pelvis as he pushed deeper inside me. I was really enjoying this, my senses were heightened after a day of fantastic sex and now I wanted more, lots more. He rode me hard and I grabbed his firm butt cheeks to hold him to good length strokes so that he excited my most sensitive parts. He wasn't going to last long I was sure, so I made the best of him rubbing against me and tightening around his length. Don't cum in me I whispered and it wasn't long before he withdrew and my hands went to draw his seed from him. He came with gusto over my abdomen. David will be pleased with me. I thought, wishing he was with me.
My hand continued stroking him but he put his hand on mine for a moment, so I licked his length, tasting myself on him until his nerve endings relaxed and I could suck and lick his crown. I wanted him back inside me soon and never did I work so hard. At last he revived and I brought him to full hardness, I bade him lay back and I lowered myself onto him, reverse cowboy style, it wasn't the best but with a bit of manoeuvring it would do nicely for my plan.
*******************************************************************************************
David
I decided that we might as well wait until the end, to give Olivia time to enjoy herself before I arrived with Abby. She was hanging onto my arm now, her breasts rubbing against me. Whenever an opportunity came I stole kisses that she reciprocated and I could feel that she was excited; I couldn't wait to get my hands on her. "Do you want to come with me or follow in your own car?" I was asking, just when someone approached her and they went into a huddle. Eventually she turned back to me, her face stricken with disappointment. "I'm sorry David, I have to deal with this."
"OK no worries, how long will it take?"
She reassured, "I don't know, not long I hope." I drew her closer and kissed her properly.
"It won't matter," I said, "would you like me to wait or join me later?"
She thought and finally decided, "I'll come to you, I have no idea how long this will take."
"It doesn't matter, we are going to make love all night and then again tomorrow, would you like that?"
She nodded almost ashamed to say as much but her disappointment said it all. I went to the person who was holding her up, "Is this so important?" I questioned the woman."
"Yes we've had a bit of disaster in the kitchen and there's no one else still here."
"Half an hour" I said firmly, "then you pack up regardless or I come back for her anyway."
I asked Abby for her phone and entered my phone and room numbers. "Don't be too long or I will come and carry you out," she giggled which I thought was a good sign. I reached and gave her another promissory kiss, then let her go. I watched her walk away. She was moving her butt just a little more than usual and finally as she passed through the door she looked back at me. I was bewitched and hadn't moved. She gave me a huge smile knowing that I had watched her little performance and liked it.
I gave Olivia plenty of time but when I stepped through the door I was looking straight into her beautiful eyes. Her face lit up but she said, "What kept you? I have been waiting." I looked at her curiously. She simply gave me one of those slow enigmatic smiles and raised a questioning eyebrow. 'Two can play that game,' I thought and I crossed the room to her. I caught Bill's anxious face as I approached and I gave him a smile to say it was ok. Then I reached for Olivia and kissed her thoroughly. When I released her lips, her face had a strange look about it as if she had lost track of where she was. Oddly, I noticed that her hips never stopped rolling back and forth on Bill's cock, autopilot I thought so I kissed her again, then I felt her breath catch, she was cumming and I was going to make sure I was part of it. My hands went to her breasts, then I bent to lick a nipple which freed up my left hand to stroke her clit. She rode him hard then, pushing her clit against my fingers and now pulling my head into her breast, it built and built until with an almost anguished cry she climaxed hard and hugged me to her,
"Thank you David, I love you so much." I kissed her again and seeing a strained look on Bill's face I said to her "put the poor man out of his misery my love." She lifted off of him, turned around and lowered herself back on with a sigh and a private smile. She moved slowly back and forth both enjoying him for herself and maximising the feel of her pussy walls on his length. She tried to make it last but he must have been waiting for a long time, his hips came up trying to get deeper and she moved off quickly, "uh, uh, ahh" no coming inside, and she lowered her mouth to bring him the satisfaction he craved.
Later Bill said, "I feel like an intruder between you, it's the strangest 'ex' relationship I ever heard of."
"Don't be offended, it's just our way, we are having some good times being away together but her motor is always running and she wants you."
"And that's ok with you?" I looked to check that Olivia was out of hearing. "No, but I have to live with it or if I let her go, she would end up in the gutter, what would you do?"
He looked at me as if I had asked the most obvious question but then didn't have an answer.
"You see, it's not that easy with a woman like Olivia, she has her needs." He shook his head with frustration at not seeing an answer, I knew that feeling.
"I shouldn't be complaining, she is one beautiful lady you have, I hope you can fix her. Would you like me to leave?" He suggested.
"Entirely up to you," I said, and strangely I meant it 'just this once I told myself.'
Abby arrived then, looking flushed and harried, she spotted Bill and said "Ohh, have I come at a bad time.
I assured her she was just fine, "Olivia is just in the shower and I'm waiting for you." She glanced at Bill. "He's been taking care of Olivia and is making up his mind whether to stay or go. Would you like a drink?" I asked.
"Yes please" I'm parched, then she looked uncomfortable so I whispered to her "Why don't you go in the shower and say hello" she looked down at her clothes then at Bill. I turned to him and went to the door, "I'm making up your mind for you, it's time to go." My respect for him went up another notch as he shook my hand goodbye. "Give her a call later ehh?"
He looked at me checking that I was serious then nodded.
"Has she got your number?" I checked then grabbed some hotel stationary for him to write on. "Good man," I said, and held the door open for him.
I turned back into the room, Abby was taking off her coat and I rushed to help her. "A gentleman too, your full of surprises David"
"I hope there's plenty more to come," I joked.
She looked me up and down and said simply "there better be lots, I'm here for a long time."
I drew her into me for a kiss and began removing her clothes, when she was shyly naked my eyes took in the wonderment of her body and my man bits enlarged at a phenomenal speed, she looked at my growing crotch area, gave it a light double tap and sashayed to the shower room. I quickly stripped myself, I did not want to miss this show.
And so began one of my most memorable nights, I watched them pleasure each other in the shower, on the bed, and on a chair at breakfast. The latter was one for the scrapbook, as Abby had declined to sit on my lap saying she was sore and knew what might happen. So she sat on Olivia and got herself a thorough fingering anyway. The sight of Abby stretched out on Olivia as her fingers danced across her breasts, her clit and her labia was so erotic that I couldn't help myself from dropping to my knees to lick her opening. I looked up into both sets of eyes, each full of affection and I felt so lucky and honoured.
During the night Olivia had convinced Abby to try anal, she being an enthusiast of her rosebud being penetrated while her clit is stimulated, or even better, both orifices penetrated at the same time. We were extremely careful with Abby and once she got used to the unusual feeling she seemed to enjoy herself, especially with Olivia licking her clit at the same time.
I think Olivia had hoped that Bill would be around so I assured her that he had our numbers. "You could give him a call yourself but I'm not sure if Abby would prefer more time just with us. She might have to go home for a while to get fresh clothes though." I left it to her to decide what plans to make with him. I was quite happy to spend time with Abby alone, if a chance came. I smiled to myself.
*************************************************
David
A little later Olivia said, "I want her to come home with us David, I like her very much and I think she would be good for me."
That last made me pause and I needed clarification "How so?"
Olivia explained, "Ohh I don't know, I think I need someone in my life who will keep my sex drive focused on you and the others. Nina's very sexy but she's too me, me. me, driven, you know what I mean?"
I did and smiled my agreement, so she went on. "Jane would have been perfect but I think I've put a wedge between us and now she spends most of her time with Bree. You will have your work cut out with those two David."
I agreed and she continued, "What I need is another sexy woman who will fill in the gaps. Jo's very good of course but aside from you she is committed to keeping everyone happy. Ana is in love at the moment, do you know anyone else who might fit the bill?"
I didn't respond so again she continued. "She would have to love me and be honest with me of course"
I looked straight into her eyes as she tried, "surely that's not too much to ask, is it?
"Olivia I can't believe you said that!"
"Do you have someone else you could suggest?"
"Not a chance if you're going to be hypocritical, how can you expect someone to be more than you are yourself?"
Her eyes glistened and I thought for a moment that she was going to cry because she looked so sad. I couldn't help myself, I pulled her half naked body to my lap and hugged her tight, kissing her eyelids and her face and then just a little tickling until she started to wiggle on my lap.
After a suitable time during which Abby re-joined us as Olivia enjoyed the effects of wiggling on my lap, or more specifically my penis, we all crashed once again on the bed. That was the thing with Abby, she didn't hang back or wait to be called, she came out of the shower room, saw what Olivia was up to and immediately joined in, licking Olivia's clitoris which set said woman off like a steam train. I thought I'd test the water and asked her, "Would you consider coming home with us?"
"Ohh I couldn't impose," she responded automatically like any well brought up girl.
"Sorry that won't wash, you wouldn't be imposing one little bit but you would be coming at an exciting time and we would like you to be with us."
She looked to Olivia for confirmation, and she responded perfectly "I would so love you to come Abby, I am going to be so lonely without you, please say you'll come until your hubby comes back."
Fine woman that she was, she didn't make a quick decision, "I'll have to think about it, there is a lot to consider, my job, my husband and my friends here"
I could see her point so I tried "You don't have to make a full decision straight away, why don't you come back with us for a week or two of your school break and see what you think, we would be honoured and delighted if you would come and be part of our new life changes. Her questioning look led me to explain about the new retreat and what it was all about, the upcoming wedding and the plans for the future. We also made her laugh about some of the antics on 'shirt' days. I went to the closet and took out one of my shirts and had her try it on, her breasts looked superb in it as the material brushed across her nipples and their size meant the shirt wasn't quite long enough to stop prying eyes like mine. Olivia had the same idea and we went to her together, she went for her pussy and I went for the breasts and she said huskily "If you two don't stop that I'll expect you to keep going" so we didn't stop and the shirt didn't stay on for long.
Late in the afternoon Bill rang and Olivia asked him over, looking at Abby to gauge her reaction. She didn't seem to respond one way or the other so I checked.
"I'm fine with it, but I don't want him David, so you will have to take care of all my needs," she smirked at me and I grinned back.
"There's only one thing," I whispered, "I think Olivia is angling for him and I to double team her.
"oh, ooh oooooooooh," she responded as the meaning slowly sank in. I watched as she disassembled the information. I think she was intrigued by the idea but didn't want Bill.
"How would you like Olivia and I to double team you?" I teased.
"But how?" she was intrigued.
"You'll see," I grinned. "Every one of our members has just such an initiation, it's become very popular except so far for our lovely lesbian." I could see I had intrigued her again."
"I thought you were about women in need of refuge."
"Yes well Lauren is, in a way," and I explained how her residence had occurred. "I'm proud to say that I am the only man she has allowed to touch her"
"I would have put money on it David." She said with a grin, wanting to ask more but Olivia had come off the phone and was giving us her puppy dog eyes which probably meant she needed our attention. I saw Abby look at me sideways and I suspected that she saw a man in need of help keeping Olivia satisfied.
Around the time that Bill was due Olivia began moving furniture around in our lounge space, configured 3 chairs in a triangle and asked Abby and I if we would sit on one of them when Bill arrived. I turned to Abby.
"I think she's going to put on a show."
"I was thinking of leaving to get my clothes while Bill was here" she responded.
"Stay for the show I said and then go while Bill and I take care of her."
"You are something else," she said, "what other real man would calmly watch his wife make love with another man."
"I'm not calm believe me but when you visit us you might realise two things, firstly she is beyond my control and second perhaps stupidly, I have this battle with myself at being a hypocrite, even now when I want you would I not be a hypocrite?"
"Maybe but we share equally whereas Bill doesn't bring his wife or girlfriend to your party."
"That's true, maybe Olivia should suggest it to him, if he is in a relationship of course, I suspect not at the moment."
"I suppose I'm a hypocrite too as I have a husband far away."
"I wondered about that, what gives?"
"Ohh I'm just horny like Olivia, I can't help it, but I also don't want to rub his nose in it so I don't play near home, you guys are perfect, you're breaking all my boundaries without him knowing."
"And I suspect you're falling fast for Olivia?" I gave her a little smile. "She's definitely reciprocating if it's true."
"But can I really have feelings for you both and still love my husband?"
"You're talking to a man who currently cares for 12 women and is about to exchange vows with 4 of them."
"But can you do that?"
"Not by law but we are only going to exchange private vows, it's also a good opportunity to have lots of fun." Then I told her about the friends from the bar and about it being the first event for our conference centre after the official opening.
Our conversation ranged on as Olivia went into the shower but I noticed the door was propped open, was that an invitation or was she eavesdropping? I decided to test the eavesdropping.
"Has Olivia ever staged a show like this before?"
"No, but I have a feeling that if it's a success it won't be the last, she has two boyfriends back home she would probably do one with!"
"Would you let her?"
I put my finger to my lips and pointed to my ear then indicated the shower door and finally winked. Abby gave me a conspiratorial grin.
"I might," I said, "if she was really good to us."
"Would I like them?" Abby played along.
"You might." I said.
Olivia couldn't help herself any longer, she burst out of the door and threw herself at us. "Would you really let me?"
"I might, if you proved that you really loved me."
"I will, but how can I do that David, you know already that you are my heart."
"I'll think of something," he said, "but can you be honest with me yet?"
"I'll try my hardest" she said in her best voice to get me to do what she wants.
"That includes telling me things that you don't think I want to hear or even if you think I'll be angry."
She pouted at that but the idea of performing with her two boys was a massive pull for her. "Oooo Kay" she drew out.
"Shall we have a test?"
She didn't think that was the best idea, so ignored it.
He couldn't think of a question he wanted the answer to immediately, so he didn't press. He did ask though, what were you doing in the shower, she coloured slightly, ohh just playing and listening.
"What were you playing with?"
"Oooh just the loofah and the shower spray" He crooked a finger at her and she came forward looking slightly worried. He pulled her down for a hot kiss and Abby joined in with her hands as Olivia leaned across her.
"What was that for?" Olivia asked when they broke their kiss.
"For being good and honest, every time you tell me something you didn't want to I am going to reward you with something super sexy in future. It could be mighty naughty," he said.
Her eyes flashed with desire, imagining what he might have in mind.
"Write down what you want and maybe I'll surprise you with something from your list. If you're really, really, good, maybe we'll play that game you want, maybe Abby might want to play too."
Abby didn't have a clue what they were talking about but right now with her fingers still caressing Olivia they could have convinced her of anything, David was right this woman is beguiling.
They played with Olivia for a while, their hands roaming over her body and Olivia drew them to the bed like a cat demanding her owners to pet and stroke her. Together they brought her to the edge and then when she was close they held her there. Abby was feasting on her clit whilst her fingers stroked the sensitive areas inside her vulva. David lubricated his fingers on her natural fluids and slid them inside her rosebud, this had the effect he hoped for as her whole body writhed against the sensory attack and an orgasm burst upon her making Olivia's whole being vibrate and tingle uncontrollably. They allowed her to recuperate before sending her back to the shower and while they waited David made slow sensual love to Abby intent on exciting every erogenous zone in her body, her cry of release was loud enough for even Olivia to hear in the shower.
A head came around the shower door, "No starting without me you two." Abby just gave her a glowing smile back that made Olivia feel very jealous. 'Perfect' thought David, 'A double bullseye.'
Finding themselves back in the living area, swathed in robes and nothing else, Abby was back on David's lap as Olivia became edgy, expecting Bill's arrival at any second. She wanted this to be perfect, for Bill, for her and strangely for David and Abby which made no sense at all.
"I remembered something else you said earlier." David said quietly to Abby, "about Olivia making love. I wanted to say that I don't think Olivia makes 'love' to her conquests like Bill, her inner devil likes to have sex with no strings attached sometimes with no logic whatsoever."
"But she loves you right?"
"What do you think?" he replied, making sure she understood that he was truly asking for her opinion.
"I think from what I have seen, she adores you totally, but in some strange mixed up way she's now bringing you sexual conquests to enjoy or to rescue her."
"For me, the jury is still out on that one, I think if she loved me that much it would be stronger than all else, but for example those two boyfriends back home, she won't let go of them and it suggests to me that she has strong feelings for them. As I surmised earlier she is angling to bring them home for a four way or 5 way or whatever and she will want you to meet them when we get home. What she would really like of course is to get me to watch while she does what she wants with them and then pull her away and fuck her brains out. It's like doing a really bad deed and then seeking redemption. It has the opposite effect from my point of view of course."
Abbey nodded thoughtfully.
David thought that Olivia could probably hear a lot of what he was saying, he had realised long ago that she heard and saw everything he did within her proximity. However he had decided that it was better for her to overhear something and think about it, rather than throw it in her face; stubborn she definitely was.
"But that's awful, you wouldn't let her do that would you?"
"I find I am becoming pragmatic about her, if I thought I would get my wife back, I might, but probably it will be the final straw before a final break apart, I already have divorce proceedings on standby."
"I can understand but it's hard to believe when I see you together."
"There were times that I loved her so much that I found myself giving in anyway, but then I started getting so used to her infidelity that it's just one more thing on top of many, many, others. It erodes other things too like trust and respect. These few days l am giving myself a holiday from such thoughts up to a point, despite everything I still have my limits."
"You are making me feel sad now and guilty, I am not much better."
"You are better because you are considerate of your husband's feelings, things like not muddying your own doorstep makes such a difference to your husbands self-respect and his position in the community, you don't rub your husbands nose in it, whereas Olivia's demon tries to do exactly that."
*****************************************************************************
I could hear Olivia rummaging around in the bedroom and I suggested to Abby that she go help her and after a strange look at me she headed inside. I wanted to catch up on what was happening at home and there were a number of messages. There was something from almost everyone, Ana was telling me she had been with Zoe over the weekend and found Zoe had bought some toys. Bree, Jane, and some of the others had been to a bar Saturday night and had a great night teasing the men but everyone got home safely. Lauren wanted to admit that she had been to a gay bar, she had enjoyed herself but she liked it better when some of the other ladies went with her. Jo said she missed her special wake-up drink and demanded double when I got home which made me laugh. Ruth told me she missed me and wanted to know when she could have another alone time, then she added that her husband heard about what we were doing regarding the golf course etc and said he wanted to meet with me. Bree sent me a little additional message saying she had been 'very good' while I was away and Jane wrote that we should enjoy ourselves while we can.
My absorption was broken by a voice saying "What are you up to there? With that smile on your face." I showed them my messages, I had nothing to hide "After reading for a while, Abby looked at me appraisingly "It's all true isn't it, I found it hard to believe, but I am convinced."
*****************************************************************************
A knock on the door had us moving quickly into our places, well Abby onto my lap and Olivia to the door. Olivia had made herself look fantastic, a little light make-up and her hair carefully brushed. She looked stunning in her robe carefully wrapped around her so that just a hint of cleavage showed. The bottom of her robe opened as she walked to show a hint of bare legs. Abby looked equally stunning and together they were so breath-taking that I found it hard to know where my eyes should look next. Bill obviously agreed with me because when Olivia opened the door he didn't move for a moment, taken as he was by the vision before him. Olivia embraced him and drew him into the room, she held him close and whispered into his ear, "I am so glad you could come, I've been looking forward to it all day and thinking of a little fun for us, I hope you don't mind but I want David and Abby to stay but they can leave if you want." He looked somewhat uncomfortable but didn't demur.
This explanation seemed to settle him some and he stepped into the door, she pulled him close and again whispered in his ear, "do you want me? Do you like what you see?" He nodded, for the moment still dumbstruck. She allowed him to hold her and kiss her, a big concession as it was one of the things she reserved for David on this trip and David himself thought it gave an indication of her self-control. Abby and I got to our feet and went to greet Bill, to try and make him feel welcome, I reckoned he had imaginings of what he was here for so was ready to go with the flow. Greetings over, Olivia said, "come with me" and led him into the bedroom leaving the door partially open of course so that our view was not interrupted. We watched as she slowly undressed him, removing his Jacket quickly then his shirt. As she did so her hands explored his body feeling the contours of his skin, stopping to kiss or lick particularly his nipples and his ears. Once satisfied she went to his feet and removed his shoes and then each sock, stopping to massage each foot just enough to relax him. That done she took her time undoing his belt and dropping his trousers, next she ran her hands up and down his legs, again just lightly massaging.
Bill stood enjoying every moment, a silly smile on his face as he soaked up the attention he was getting. Now was the finale, she excruciatingly slowly drew his pants down over his cock admiring every inch, as it came into view, now hard from the teasing she was giving him. Even Abby gave a hitch of breath as his manhood sprang forth in all its glory and Olivia let out a soft "mmmm" of appreciation.
"Are you a bit of a size queen?" I whispered into Abby's ear, tormenting her although from what I could see Bill was packing nothing abnormal.
She flushed just a little, "sometimes, but only on a fantasy level." Then she teased. "What have you got in mind?"
I decided I didn't need to say anything, preferring to pull her robe up so that her lady bits were rubbing on the size I would be offering. She squirmed around a little, teasing me until positioned exactly how she wanted me.
Back in the bedroom, Olivia was running her hands up and down the inside of his thighs, now applying fleeting kisses close to the top and near enough so that her skin brushed against his cock as she moved. She kissed closer and closer each time tormenting him, then she had him sit back on a chair prepositioned of course and she began in earnest to lick and kiss the area between his scrotum and his anus, stroking his balls gently and a finger teasing his anus. We thought he would explode when he let out a cry of pent up need and then finally she put him through the final torment, her fingers of one hand went to his rod, at first just admiring and touching to feel the soft yet hard erection, then stroking in earnest. Now she stole a look at Abby and I, with an expression that said how clever am I? Look how hard and proud I have made his cock stand and then saying I want this badly and asking, 'may I please?' I gave her my usual controlled smile nod of acknowledgement, there was no way I would give her my encouragement.
She turned her eyes back to look into his, a look that I knew well to be of such sexual allure a man could refuse her nothing. Her mouth dipped to kiss the tip then her tongue swept across the plain then down the sensitive areas. Then she licked up and down his entire length time and again her eyes locked on his before she put him out of his misery as she began to suckle him and take him into her mouth, gradually deeper and deeper then pushing it into the beginning of her throat and back out again, then up and down her lips tight around his rod as best she could with her teeth held back, sucking, and licking all the while. Eventually she took to licking back and forth rapidly across his most sensitive parts at his crown and his whole body arched and shook as his mind numbing orgasm hit him and his seed was captured by Olivia's hands.
It was quite a show I had to ruefully admit, my wife was a master of sex I knew and a sick feeling in my stomach gave testament to the knowledge that much of it would have been learnt with other people. Abby had been consistently rubbing against my hardness but looked around in alarm as I softened rapidly with that sick feeling, "Did I do something wrong?" she asked desperately. I held her very close, taking solace from the closeness of her pliant body. She looked at me and dawning gradually came, expressed by understanding and pity in her eyes. "It's so hard on you to have to watch?"
"She's so expert, and it wasn't from experience with me." I uttered, unable to explain properly.
Abby kissed me because it was all she could think to do and for a while she just held me. Finally she asked, "Are you sure about all this?"
"Yes, I don't have a choice, really."
Olivia got up to wash off and looked towards David and Abby holding each other close, comforting him. She found herself intensely and uncontrollably jealous and her inner self became at war with her other self, she'd been the one to put on a great sex show yet Abby was getting the hugs and kisses, how was that right?
Returning from washing, Olivia went to the wardrobe to fetch one of the robes provided by the Hotel, she helped it on Bill and found it short enough that if his rod had been erect it would hang below, she cheekily felt inside and gave his sensitive cock a stroke then taking it in her hand she led him into the living room. As she entered the lounge Olivia had a glow of success, stage one of her plan was achieved and she had hoped David would be jealous, her pussy now ached for attention.
The next stage in her plan was a game of cards, the point of the game was to gradually raise the stakes of sex, with a turn of the card there was a kiss on the lips, next a kiss, suck, or lick of the nipples, then a stroke or suck of the genitals or finally sex. Each to last depending upon whether it's a Jack 15 seconds up to Ace a full minute Then she went to her case and brought out a bag, inside were two dildos and a strap. The guys were looking worried, there was no way they were touching each other. She pottered around making everything ready keeping the men on edge, they began to feel very uncomfortable. Then Abby caught sight of a momentary slip by Olivia as a secret smile came to her face. Abby threw herself into the tease with alacrity and Olivia drew her into the game with great joy.
The game commenced, the men on edge, hoping they wouldn't find themselves coupled. Olivia and Abby winked at each other, then Olivia looked down at the toys before looking seductively into Abby's eyes and gesticulating with a 'you and me babe later' action. Abby blushed intensely, this weekend had been her first full relationship with a woman, her first experience of anal sex and now she might be dildoed. The mixture of fear and excitement was intoxicating and she wiggled in her seat wishing she was still on David's lap, she was in love with that part of him, the rest of him wasn't bad either she laughed to herself.
