Against your better judgment, what you'd sworn was a singular (and later, a double) act of impulsive perversion on your part had become something of a ritual, every time you saw them now. Such behavior was as foreign to you as these shores had been when you climbed off the boat, but like a shape of light freed from arbitrary, ethical moorings, you'd painted a wholly new, terribly lascivious self-portrait...and you liked the satisfied being you saw.
It started when, not for the first time, you decided to listen to the smooth-talking, sleek devil on your shoulder. The context was a day like many others, defined by the chaos of public transit; the red line had gone down (again), and with the kind of inefficiency you associated with underpaid, overworked transit officials scrambling to get through another work day, they piled into the train car ferrying you to your job.
-KssSsst-TANIS AND POLASKI. PLEASE -WHEEZE- ACCOMMODATE THE EXTRA PASSENGER LOAD, WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE, THANK YOU-kssSt-
Oh no.
The doors open, and humanity spills in fluid-like to fill the space. Three times you are tossed like a slender, shapely bit of driftwood in whitewater rapids that stink of bad cologne and swamp-country breakfast, even as you grasp for the handlebar futilely. You find yourself forced up uncomfortably against the steel-panel wall of the car, a TV screen eagerly delivering the news in Spanish.
-kssSSt-GOREK AND SMITH -wheEEeeze-KSSst-
You brace yourself, holding on desperately to your tiny patch of space, like the baroness of a ravaged little land through which The City's barbaric proletariat rampaged and rather than being torn away, the stream of humanity pushes against you.
But this time something is different.
You become exquisitely aware of a man's body pressed against yours from behind, and hear the little devil whispering in your ear.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:There's a man behind you, Anastasia.
You:I know. What of it?
The Devil on Your Shoulder:You can feel him...he's tall like a tree, his shoulders are broad, and look. His forearms.
You look and quietly 'ohh' at the way tendons stand out like cables beneath his pale, auric skin; they're straining to push against the wall and, you realize, the undifferentiated mass of people behind him. Why was he...?
The Devil on Your Shoulder:He's trying to keep you from being crushed you horny dolt. He's being nice...so don't go thinking too hard about how you can feel the buttons of his shirt, his stubble catching in your hair, and ohhh...the shape of his chest. It's a nice chest, isn't it.
You:Stop that!
The Devil on Your Shoulder:And unlike almost everyone else, he smells good. What is that, Anastasia? A bite of mint from his toothpaste? Just a bit of sweat from traversing the morning heat?
You:Maybe, but -
The Devil on Your Shoulder:- and...that...is...his...package. Against your ass.
You have nothing to say in response to yourself, because the Devil on Your Shoulder is (as always) correct: the bulge of his masculinity is pressing on your rear, but only momentarily as he leans his hips back to keep from further dishonoring you, a woman he is unacquainted with. "I'm so, so sorry," he whispers to you in an accent that is certainly not Dixie. Aghast at the situation, he unintentionally delights you with a feat of strength as he pushes the complaining, griping crowd back and gives you a few centimeters of breathing space.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Pffft. Acting sweet. That makes you want him even more.
You:I don't -want- him, I don't even know his name -
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Oh Anastasia, you know that's never stopped...and besides, why, oh why then, are you grinding back against his cock?
...good question. Why, in fact, are you looking over your shoulder at him with sultry, parted red lips, hooded dark eyes, slowly sashaying your hips side to side against his groin? Why do you, in fact, love the way you can feel him twitching toward hardness?
His breathing shifts, and you feel him strain against the impulse of bucking against you.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Look at how he's controlling himself for you, Anastasia.
You:I'm weirding him out / I don't want to stop / I kinda don't want him to control himself.
This little dance persists for three more stops.
The train car empties of some of its passenger load, like a great whale disgorging the contents of its guts onto the beach of the subway platform before being filled back up again mercilessly; with the ebb and flow of riders he pushes back to give you some room before the two of you are crushed together again, and you feel his pecs, his abs, his rock-hardmanhood. It's really impressive the way he pushes back against the brackish river of pink, tan and dark flesh, and each time he is shoved against you, you grow increasingly bold.
First, you grind the plush softness of your ass up and down the distinct shape of his shaft...and perhaps unable to resist the call of his masculine instincts, he delights you by rolling his hips back.
When he returns again, you actually widen your stance and open your thighs, exhaling a little puff of ecstasy when you feel him his shaft press against you, soaked and slicked beneath the silk of your underwear.
You actually mold your body against his and actually reach up and around to touch his face, looking at it in the reflection of the window. "I'm not a pervert, I swear," he whispers, among other things. "It's these pants, honestly," and "...so you doing anything later?" You don't say anything back to him, and part of it is your own inclination toward mystique, but also you're kind of...staring.
You:My gosh, he is...really good looking.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Interesting, isn't it...at once your type, yet not a type you've explored. Better though, look at those pretty, dark eyes of his...they're long like a fox's. Mixed heritage, perhaps?
You:Maybe...he's a bit mysterious, no? He has such a nice mouth.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:You're thinking about it doing things to you, like kissing your neck, your shoulders, sucking your nipples -
You:-am not -
The Devil on Your Shoulder:- licking your clit -
You:Stop! Stop stop, I'm not -
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Yet here you are, stroking and playing with his cock.
It is true. You are reaching down, exploring him from his tip down the haft of his lance. Through his cargos you easily make out the engorged shape of his glans, the girth of his shaft; you touch him down to his testicles, and when you finally reach your stop, you give him a little mysterious smile, and squeeze out, through the crowd.
For the rest of the day you burned with self-ridicule, your head hung with the chain-weight of shame.
When night fell, you told yourself ardently that you wouldn'teverdo anything like that again, even as you take out your new curved, fat blue toy with its vibrating little ears. You buzz and fuck yourself, purging yourself of your own depravity, promising that with this orgasm your mind would be clear, and yet...
You're picturing him holding you against the wall of your apartment, staring heatedly into your eyes as he ruts his cock into you, churning your juices and leaving them dripping down his thighs. You fantasize the texture of his lips and tongue against yours, of how your nectars would make his shaft shine and his balls drip with you.
The next day, waking up refreshed and actually leaving on time for once, you discover that the Red Line is, indeed, down for the entirety of the week. You'd been forcing yourselfnotto think about the nameless subway passenger, to focus instead on the project awaiting you at work but the knowledge that this situation has the potential to repeat itself has your heart dancing in your chest.
What if you see him again? Should you ignore him if he talks to you? It's unlikely, millions of people pass through the subway everyday...but...what if?
You join the queue; you climb on and find, of course, that all the seats are taken, so you search for a safe place and brace yourself for the passenger rush, and dismiss the chance that you'd see him again -
Oh wait, there he is, you see him in the reflection of the window at the head of the new flow of commuters and he's moving incredibly fast toward you, holding his arms out to stop himself. This time, you turn to face him and calmly watch as his hands smack against the wall on either side of your head, looking up at him coolly.
You both regard one other wordlessly; he's admiring you with some surprise, though you wonder if he'd purposely chosen this entrance on the off-chance he might see you again.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:You hope he did.
You:You don't gotta mock me...
The Devil on Your Shoulder:I never meant to imply he didn't...what if he did?
You can't help but enjoy the way he looks at you, since you did put a bit of work into looking nice today...not for him, of course. Even though you're really glad you're extra looking put-together today.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Interesting. He's kind of got all the features you liked on your ex-boyfriends, only he's...
You:Ripped, I know. I didn't think I'd like muscles but -
The Devil on Your Shoulder:- you do, don't you.
You:I do.
This...nameless man stops fighting the horde of humanity and their irresistible current, although he's kind enough to push back against their pressure lest you be compacted against the cold, misted glass window. There's just enough of a tiny bubble around you that his skin and clothing barely touch yours, and you only now take the time to notice his casual attire...come to think about it you'd never seen him in a collared shirt or anything vaguely professional; you take more time to notice him.
It's an ongoing effort to maintain that bubble around you, the way his almondine eyes roam down your athletic figure with intent, bare centimeters of space between your lips and his, such that you can feel and smell his peppermint breath. It isn't as if you, a veteran of the public transit system, haven't been in such close proximity with someone whose name you didn't even know, but this is far more like a simulacra of sexual intimacy than any unintentional breach of personal space by a stranger.
Tension crackles between you both as you take him in. His dark brown hair is cut short, dancing on the edge between stylishly messy and casual, and his jawline is pleasantly smooth, though your gaze crawls along scars and nicks that run like dry riverbeds over his skin.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Is he dangerous? Not your usual fare...you've always liked them just a little effeminate and soft.
You:I don't go for bad boys, and I'm not starting now.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Liar.
It is true, he possesses an edge that reminds you of ground steel stropped against a leather band, with his aquiline nose and high cheekbones; you would be hard pressed to place his ethnicity. Mixed perhaps, his eyes are deep-set but you note an epicanthic fold; the shadow of dark stubble clings along the lower half of his face, surrounding a generous, if sheepish smirk. "Fancy seeing you here again."
You don't say anything back...part of it is the maintenance of your own sense of glamour, but you're also struck quiet, searching for words as you stare at him. The little devil on your shoulder is right, he isn't your usual fare but he has many of the features you found attractive in a line of ex-boyfriends and flings both memorable and forgettable. The lines of his physique are temptingly visible through the white cotton of a T-shirt; plain, but for a string of crimson Chinese characters in the center - 批評小熊. Hmm...your mind drifts briefly to your upcoming meeting with the Minister but like a virtual particle vanishing back into the ether, the thought dissipates back into the ether.
"So...actually, I was thinking the other day - "
-kssssT-NEXT STOP FOR BAXTER AND DUVAYRA-KssSSsst-
He's interrupted by the next rush of sweat-sheened flesh on to the train, and you actually watch cracks appear in the plastic before even his considerable strength gives way and the sheer mass at his back presses him against you.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Ahhh this again...tight up against the wall but it feels like you're the only two here, doesn't it. Makes you feel a little more...confident? Daring, perhaps?
You:...perhaps.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:What do you have in mind this time, you deviant? Are you going to just...let your hand stray again, or do you intend to one-up yourself?
Your palms are flat against the cuirass-hardness of his chest, you can feel the war-drum of his heartbeat under the fingers of your right hand. He smells like Old Spice, and you spot a bead of perspiration trailing down his neck; your most unacceptable, unCatholic instincts instruct you lap it up. The ferrous hardness in his eyes melts aside when he gazes upon you - you see it, softening like a rainy day, tempting as honey.
You:*Watch me.*
The inside of your ankle snakes gingerly along his calf, your long, caramel-dark leg curling around his as you close the space between the fulsome, masculine bulge in his camo-fatigues and your own feminine heat. The pressure of your closeness with him, the growing hardness of his cock both send a low-thrumming stormfront of tingling need through your pelvis. It's...one of the hottest things you can recall in the waning years of your wild 20s, grinding yourself against a desirable man while surrounded by people.
His body obfuscates you, even as he's caught in your movements and rolls his hips back against you - unbidden a breathy, feminine exhalation of delight escapes your throat. Your painted lips hang open and youknowyour expression must be positively libidinous, like a doe in heat...sharing it with a man whose name you don't even know, the clitter-clack of the train track a convenient cover for the rapidly increasing tempo of your breath. Your panties are growing wet -godyou're going to leave a mark on his fly, but it's so hard to care in the heat of the moment.
"Unnhh..." it shivers forth across your tongue, like pink mist crawling from your throat.
"Hey..." he whispers, his hand moving from your shoulder to lightly caress your face - the timing is amazing, so sweet you don't notice he's trying to get your attention, and you're actually starting to reach a plateau that will soon vault up into the cloudy peaks of your climax.
You grip the collar of his shirt, squirming your hips in the throes of an approaching orgasm against his girth.
"Nnnhaa, hey..." he tries again, even as he clenches your ass; you feel him buck against you, an uncontrolled thrust that brings to mind images of your fists gripping sheets, of his powerful body looming over you, fucking you in the mattress.
"I think this is where you get off," he whispers.
Ffffuck yes it is OH SHIT
You were so caught up in the stimulation of the moment that you completely missed the staticky announcement, your stop passing you by minutes ago; your thighs quivering underneath your skirt, slicked and slippery with your arousal, a near-transcendent awareness of time and space blossoms fearfully in your mind.
Your slender frame slips through sliding doors with cat-like grace but like a newling fawn your long legs collide with each other and nearly send you tumbling onto the platform. It's a bad enough spaz-move that hemustbe sneering at you, his eyes (and other commuters') following your rocket-dash to the other side.
Your cheeks are bright like maraschino cherries, your nipples rubbing against the soft material of your shirt, sensitive little diamonds and you're so wet it's embarrassing.
What fit of madness had come over you in that man's presence, as if the Little Devil's whispers were the overture of her possession? You catch your breath, unable to resist looking back when you reach the stairwell.
He's pressed against the glass from the chest down - the imprint of his musculature is clear to see, and ohlordthereisan obvious wet spot over the hard, long bulge in his pants that you'd been pleasing yourself upon. Inpublicno less.
By the time you finally make it to Baxter and DuVayra you've recomposed yourself. Up the elevator and onto the street, a couple blocks jog to the office in the swelter of the Gulf Coast summer has you perspiring like a sweat-basted sow. Fortunately, when you reach the air-conditioned sanctuary of your office - a space you'd slaved for at the whim of monstrously wealthy yacht-owners - you're able to lock your door, lower the shades over the crystal-glass windows, and strip out of your perspiration-coated blouse and skirt, as well as your underwear, potent with the scent of your lust.
Your ex-girlfriend had been possessed of outsized wealth, and often spent it on any number of new outfits for you to wear for her - consequently your closets at home overflowed, so you kept a few changes here in your suite. A fresh, periwinkle dress and white cardigan, crisp and free of any evidence of your...incredibly risky, debauched public conduct; the picture of soft, feminine purity.
Still...the rest of the workday crawls by, the dull throbbing need between your thighs like the bell of some profane temple of lust, ringing through meetings and compiling reports. Your thoughts keep flittering to him, reminiscent of a locust jumping between branches in the peach tree of your imagination.
What was he like? Based on what you'd seen, he may have actually been a sweet man under that rough, yet sharply cut exterior. He'd certainly seemed to have your wellbeing at the forefront of his mind, even when you were massaging his crotch.
The chances of seeing him again are slim, and you didn't even catch his name, so...your mind is drawn to the little black book you keep in your dresser drawer. There were a few boys and girls you could ring up for a good time - drinks and some potentially mind-blowing sex.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:You're thinking about calling Stacy, with her questing, deep-delving tongue...oh, or maybe Max? His balls are magnificent, and you've gotten to experience them.
You:I...maybe, just...train-guy, he's different.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:He is; and coward you are, you didn't ask him his number. You just not-so-dry humped him against a corner like a fucking adolescent. Anastasia, I thought you left this part of yourself in San Eduardo - I like it.
The truth of it settles on your withers like a hooker's kiss. You're not in your right mind...youhaveto get home and fix this.
Your last meeting of the day with the Minister of Finance from Changsha ends mercifully; it's going to be a long elevator ride unfortunately, since his cadre is scattered throughout the entirety of the skyscraper. At least you don't have to talk...but unfortunately it's getting claustrophobic by the 95th floor. There are at least sixteen chatting, talking suits around you, most of them older, doughy men from Hubei who showed absolutely no interest in your presence.
At the 92nd floor...it got positively tight. How many people could this damn thing hold?
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Hey...Hey, Anastasia.
You:Nope. Now is not the time -
The Devil on Your Shoulder:There's a man in the elevator.
You:There are many men in the elevator.
The Devil on Your Shoulder:You know exactly what I mean...the man behind you. The man you've noticed before here, oh so many times, drifting along in a Great Cloud of Knowing, like the king of his own little pocket realm. You like that, don't you...
...it's true. You do like that about the man standing behind you and slightly to the right - you'd never asked him his name, no reason had ever truly presented itself to make his acquaintance, though you'd often watched him. You realize this is the first time you've seen him with his hands free - normally they're occupied with a tablet, a laptop, or carrying some nameless tangle of network technology you couldn't identify.
As with many of the men you found yourself drawn to, he's tall, with the body of a track runner. His deep, walnut-dark skin and pale gray eyes were a color contrast you found fetching, and he always carries himself with leonine regality in his noble-colored blazers. Today he shines in silver, with matching, fitted slacks over his long legs. Clean-shaven, his hair cropped short, his visage looks as if it were carved by an expert hand, angular and aristocratic. A pair of platinum-framed glasses rest on the bent bridge of his nose, the reflection of a tablet-screen held in the busy, oily hands of the finance minister playing across the lenses.
Surreptitiously (perhaps a little too much so) you crane a glance over your shoulder at him, down the buckle of his belt and...
The Devil on Your Shoulder:See that? Of course you do...it's hard not to notice the shape of his manhood beneath those slacks, isn't it; not the first time you've looked either.
You:What is up with me today?! I'm not normally like this, it's like...it's like that guy on the train addled me, or you're doing something to me!
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Don't blame us for your deviant behavior - come now, I'm here to keep you honest with yourself. You just want both of them.
You:I don't even know his name...
She doesn't respond, it'd be too easy.
When your eyes drift up from his groin, you find him smiling at you. You're taken aback by his inviting warmth; it's as if he's waiting for you to say something to him - but that's not really your style, is it? You quirk your lips upward at him, a coy cupid's recurve, and examine his reflection in the steel doors of the elevator.
90th floor...it opens, and a few more people jostle for entry, squeezing you all together - unsurprisingly you find yourself...pinned against him.
Ugh thiscityjust hastoo many people.
Your hand is resting on his thigh, pushed there by the rotund presence of the Minister ahead of you. This tall, dark man chortles suave as modal, quiet enough that only you can hear...certainly not inconvenienced as much as amused. Once again, the moth wings of temptation flutter in your lower belly, and you find yourself achingly aware of howcloseyou'd been to cumming on the train, only to be denied when you had to rush onto the other side of the platform.
The back of his hand rests against the round firmness of your ass, and you can see that he's making eye-contact with you in the reflection of the elevator doors...with almost rehearsed simultaneity, bare movements within the packed confines of the elevator, your long, delicate fingers drift feather-light up his leg, a cheeky expression covering for the brazenshockyou feel for your inexplicable reactions; his hand climbs up beneath your dress, and you find your thighs parting almost of their own accord...eager for this stranger's touch.
You explore the bulbous, juicy crown of his manhood, caressing it through the smooth fabric. He's got a really nice dick, and your imagination immediately begins to mold an image of his sizable,bigshaft. You press your lips together, cheeks puffing out slightly as you restrain an involuntary gasp when he gropes further still, pushing past the seam of your sheer panties to find your smooth, goose-fleshed skin. You can feel the ridge of his cockhead in your gentle grasp, his length giving a winsome pulse as you track down to where it thickens at the base, meeting his balls.
His fingers have made the questing journey toward the cleft between your thighs, and you feel them move curiously over the dampness that has, once again, started to cling to the material of your underwear. You consciously work to keep your breathing steady and even when he splits the pink, swollen slit of your pussy, traveling toward your clitoris which practicallyquiverswith the need to be touched; you can feel his precum soaking through his slacks, warm to the touch.
Just hours ago, you'd eagerly stroked, and practicallyfuckedthat pretty, musclebound boy's bulge against your sex, now here you were doing something of the same thing to this tall, svelte man in a packed elevator...
What was it about being in public that got you going like this, lately? Your fingers are moving in little circles over the place where his cum is soaking through, hot against his fly; you hear him sigh, his cock twitching against your touch. If you keep working, will you be able to get him to ejaculate...? That's not appropriate, not in such an enclosed space...right? Ohfuck he's touching your clit, oh god he's plucking it like a harp and it feels really good.
And then suddenly you're on the lobby floor, and everyone is filing out, Mandarin and Hubeinese chattering around you. That doesn't stop him from pressing your little pearl like a button once more, triggering a mini-orgasm that causes your legs to tighten around his hand momentarily as your cheeks redden and you useevery last ounce of your will to keep it togetherbefore he pulls his hand out from under your skirt, smirks at you knowingly, and drifts out to meet a small group of suited men, waiting nearby. He laughs it up with them like nothing had happened back there.
How?
Why?
The Devil on Your Shoulder:Don't you remember telling Lola about your thing for messing around in public?
You:Please don't remind me...
The Devil on Your Shoulder:It never went away. You were just too ashamed of the way she responded, how she made you feel disgusting, but she's gone now and these men are game, so...that's how and why.
You have to get the fuck out of here and back home.
