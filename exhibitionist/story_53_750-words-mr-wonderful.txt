I told my wife Elena that I might be bisexual. Half a day of shock later, she took it well.
"Does that mean you want to fuck men?" she finally asked. A reasonable question.
"I'd never cheat," I said. "But, hypothetically... yeah."
We'd already made a full itinerary for our vacation--a trip to a notorious party city. Now that we were there, Elena was feeling spontaneous.
"There's tons of gay bars here," she said. "Don't you want to see what it's like?"
We were far enough from home that we'd never run into anyone we knew.
"I'm curious," I admitted.
She had me put on my airport clothes--a roomy t-shirt and worn jeans. Out came the scissors from her travel sewing kit.
Immediately, I felt nervous.
I said, "We're just going to see what it's like, right?"
"Of course. But you have to dress to go out"
She cropped the shirt above my navel, then she turned my jeans into cutoffs at mid-thigh. I grimaced when she reconsidered and cut them higher.
We ended up at a bar we found online. I don't know what I expected. It was like any other bar, except nobody looked straight.
I was worrying that I didn't belong. Then a twink with long hair said he liked my outfit. I'd never felt so good about a compliment in my life.
We sat at the bar. I downed my first drink and immediately ordered another. Elena sipped hers.
"Anybody look... interesting?" she said.
Sometimes, she asked questions about my preferences in men. I never knew how to answer.
I looked around. On a practical level, I had no idea what I would even do with another man.
Before I could point out the twink, the guy next to us interrupted.
He was a head taller than me and easily twice my weight. He had a big mustache. The backs of his hands were hairy. His voice was sonorous.
He didn't give his name. In my head, I named him Mr. Wonderful.
"Next one's on me," he said, then added, "if it's okay with her."
Elena smiled. "By all means."
Back in the room, she sat in the armchair, not even pretending not to watch while Mr. Wonderful and I stood by the bed and made out.
She had offered me the choice: she could make herself scarce, go read in the motel lobby awhile, or she could stay with me.
I didn't want her to witness me in potentially marriage-ending acts of homosexuality. But I was scared, so she stayed.
Mr. Wonderful embraced me with strong arms. He tilted his head down and pushed his tongue into my mouth. His mustache tickled. He pressed his pelvis against mine, letting me feel his boner through his pants.
Nimbly, he slid my shorts down, gripped my cock through my underwear. I was hard as a rock--god, his touch felt good. He was powerful, but careful, as if I were made of glass.
"I love the way your cock looks in those tighty whities," he rumbled.
We got naked. (I tried not to stare.) I sat on the edge of the bed. He knelt between my knees. He slurped my cock in long, slow strokes, night and day from Elena's reliable head-bobbing technique.
Between his hot, wet mouth and the feeling that we were doing something wrong, I was already halfway to orgasm.
At one point, he said, "Want me to stick a finger in your ass?"
I looked over his shoulder at Elena. She nodded.
"I... don't think so," I said.
He shrugged and went back to it. Slowly, expertly, he coaxed forth a thrumming, abiding orgasm. He swallowed until I was spent.
Timidly, I offered to return the favor. He laughed, and offered to masturbate in front of us instead.
"I like to be watched," he explained.
He stood tall. I reclined in his huge shadow as his hand pistoned his cock. I always thought I looked stupid when I masturbated, but he looked like a god, naked and gleaming. His sweat smelled incredible.
When he was close, he asked me if I'd like to take it in my mouth. This time, when Elena nodded, I agreed. Warm, eggy stuff thudded in my throat, slightly bitter. I gulped it down.
While he got dressed, I asked for his number. He laughed again.
"You'll learn how these things go."
He gave Elena a gentlemanly nod, and left. That was the last we ever heard of Mr. Wonderful.
