My name is Patsy Barrett. I am the 43-year-old wife of Connor Barrett. My best friend is Trixie Fuller, my next-door neighbor. I have long blonde hair and blue eyes and very large breasts that too often attract attention. I am modest in my dress, but somehow I keep ending up naked in public. It embarrasses me, but my friends and family find it funny. Like the other day...
Trixie and I were having lunch at our favorite cafe. Just as we were about to dig into our delicious tacos, my phone buzzed with an incoming call from our friend Grace. Grace's voice dripped with joy as she announced that she was engaged. Trixie and I squealed in delight.
Grace asked if I would do her the honor of being her maid of honor. I was surprised, as I did not know Grace very well and had barely met her fiance, Andrew. My heart swelled with pride as I happily agreed, already imagining myself standing by her side on the big day.
Before my excitement could settle in, Grace blurted out a special request. She explained that she needed me to keep an eye on her fiance at his bachelor's party that night. A wave of uncertainty washed over me as my mind raced with questions.
"What exactly do you mean by 'keep an eye'?" I asked.
Grace assured me, "You just need to let me know what he gets up to. Especially with the stripper."
I foolishly agreed without fully comprehending what I was getting myself into.
When I hung up the phone, I pondered how I was supposed to keep an eye on Grace's fiance at his bachelor party. I couldn't come up with a single plausible idea.
Thankfully, Trixie was there to save the day. She leaned in closer and said in her matter-of-fact tone, "Well, bestie, if you want to be a woman at a bachelor party, there's only one option."
I was glad Trixie was here to help. "And what might that be?"
Trixie grinned mischievously before delivering her bombshell suggestion. "You're gonna have to be the stripper."
My jaw dropped open in shock as I stared at Trixie. Me? A stripper? The very thought made me blush from head to toe.
"I don't know about this," I said. "I mean me stripping?"
Trixie said. "Come on, bestie! It'll be fun! Think about all those hunky guys drooling over you while you do your thing."
As Trixie's words sank in, part of me wanted to embrace this wild idea, but most of me felt bashful and hesitant about baring it all for strangers.
"It's the only way to keep your promise," Trixie said.
After much internal debate and reluctance, I gave in to Trixie's simple argument.
With a sigh of surrender, I said, "Fine, I'll do it. But only for Grace."
I had no idea what to wear or do to be a stripper. The closest I had ever come to anything remotely resembling stripping was that one time in college when I drunkenly danced on top of a table at a frat party.
Fortunately for me, Trixie told me she knew how to be a stripper. I was so happy to have her help.
"First we need to find you the perfect outfit," Trixie said.
"Okay, but nothing too revealing," I warned her.
Trixie laughed. "Bestie, it's not what shows when you're wearing your clothes that will matter."
After lunch Trixie drove me to a lingerie shop. As we walked through the aisles filled with various lingerie and costumes, my cheeks flushed with embarrassment.
"What about this?" Trixie held up a skimpy black lace bodysuit with strategically placed cutouts.
My eyes widened in shock as I took in the sheer amount of skin it would reveal. "Are you kidding me? That's practically see-through!"
Trixie tossed it back onto the rack. "Suit yourself," she said and pulled out another option - a red leather corset paired with black fishnet stockings.
I bit my lip as I imagined myself strutting around in such provocative attire. It was definitely more daring than anything I had ever worn before.
"I don't know if I can pull off something like that," I muttered.
Trixie gave me a playful wink. "Oh, trust me, bestie. In this outfit, you'll feel like a confident sex goddess."
I hesitated for a moment, my mind swirling with conflicting thoughts. The idea of parading around in a skimpy outfit made me feel both excited and nervous. But I had agreed to be Grace's spy, and if that meant disguising myself as a stripper, then so be it.
Reluctantly, I said "Alright, fine. Pick some options."
Trixie picked out several stripper outfits for me to try.
She grinned as she handed them to me. "Come on, bestie! You're going to rock this!"
With anxiety coursing through my veins, I went into the dressing room.
I looked through and picked the outfit with the most fabric. It consisted of four-inch stiletto heels, thigh high stockings with a garter belt, g-string panties, matching black lace bra, a white blouse that was sheer enough to see through, and a skirt that would barely cover my bottom.
My eyes widened as I took in the sheer sexiness of it all.
"I can't believe I'm actually going to wear this," I muttered under my breath, feeling a blush creeping up my neck.
I took a deep breath, my hands trembling as I began undressing, peeling off each layer of clothing until I stood before the mirror completely naked. My reflection stared back at me, vulnerable and uncertain. My eyes trailed over every curve and imperfection on my body, feeling a mix of self-consciousness and anticipation.
With a shaky hand, I slipped into the black lace bra and matching thong - strips of fabric that left little to the imagination. I shivered at how exposed and vulnerable they made me feel.
I finished dressing and looked at myself in the mirror. Was I ready for this? Could I pull it off?
Taking a deep breath, I stepped out of the dressing room and modeled for Trixie, who clapped excitedly. "Bestie, you look great. Now all you need to be the perfect spy is to dance like a stripper. Show me your moves."
I was standing half naked in the middle of a store. I was too embarrassed to walk around, let alone dance.
Trixie sensed my hesitation and gave me some advice on how to act like a real stripper.
"Remember," she said with an encouraging smile. "Confidence is key here. Move your body slowly and sensually -- tease them."
I took a deep breath. It was almost all women in the store. I could try this here. My heart pounded in my chest as I hesitantly began to move my body, attempting to mimic what I had seen in movies or heard about from friends. I tried to remember Trixie's advice and let go of my inhibitions. Slowly, sensually, I swayed my hips and ran my hands along my curves.
The other shoppers gathered around, their eyes on me as if they were waiting for a show. My cheeks burned with embarrassment as phone cameras flashed throughout the store. It felt like all eyes were on me, judging every move I made.
Trixie's tips seemed to be working because, even though nerves still fluttered inside me, the crowd erupted into whistles and applause.
A mix of embarrassment and pride washed over me. It was surreal but exhilarating to see how much they enjoyed watching me dance like a stripper -- a role so far removed from who Patsy Barrett typically was.
When I stopped, women approached me with compliments and admiration for my performance. Their words both embarrassed me yet made me feel like I could actually do this.
I quickly made my way back to the dressing room. My heart pounded with a mix of exhilaration. I couldn't believe what I had just done - dancing like a stripper in front of strangers for their entertainment.
Trixie stopped me, a mischievous glint in her eyes.
"You looked so good in that outfit," she said. "Why don't you wear it out?"
My eyes widened in disbelief as I stared at her. "Are you serious? Walk through the parking lot like this?" I gestured down at myself, barely covered by scraps of lace.
Trixie shrugged. "Think about it. If you're not willing to wear those clothes here and now, then there's no way you'll be able to do it at a bachelor party."
Reluctantly accepting Trixie's reasoning, I nervously followed her outside, still wearing the stripper outfit. The moment I stepped foot into the parking lot, I could feel everyone's eyes on me. My face flushed with embarrassment as I tried to cover my body with my hands, but it was no use. The outfit didn't leave much to the imagination, and my attempts at modesty only drew more attention.
As I made my way to Trixie's car, I couldn't help but feel like a walking spectacle. Every step felt like a spotlight shining down on me, exposing every inch of my barely-covered skin. People passing by stared, some with curiosity and others with judgment.
I got into the car, hunched down, and crossed my arms over my chest in a feeble attempt at hiding myself further.
But as Trixie started the engine and pulled out of the parking lot, her laughter filled the air.
"Bestie," she laughed. "You might as well embrace it now. This is what it will be like at the bachelor party."
"Bestie," I said hesitantly, "maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all."
She let out an exasperated sigh.
"You agreed to do this for Grace's sake! Remember?" she said.
I was proud Grace had chosen me as her maid of honor and entrusted me with this difficult task. And I always kept my promises. I sighed and sank back into my seat.
"I know," I said. "I will do this for Grace."
Trixie drove me to her home. The short drive was a blur, my mind consumed by thoughts of what awaited me at the bachelor party. When I got out of her car, I noticed my neighbors peering out their windows. As I made my way into Trixie's house, they followed my every move, eager to capture every scandalous moment on their phones.
I couldn't help but feel a mix of embarrassment and frustration at how often I found myself in these situations. But at least this time, I had clothes on - even if they could barely be considered clothes.
We went to Trixie's vanity. "Now for your makeup," Trixie said.
I admitted I had no idea how to create the look of a stripper. Trixie assured me that she would do my stripper makeup for me. I thanked her for her help. As nervous as I was, I needed all the help I could get..
Trixie grabbed an array of cosmetics from her vanity and began applying them with expert precision. She painted my lips with a bold shade of bright red lipstick, making them appear plump and inviting. Then, she coated my lashes with layers upon layers of dark mascara, giving my eyes a seductive allure.
When I looked in the mirror, I was taken aback by the face staring back at me. Gone was the demure homemaker Patsy Barrett; instead, I saw a woman who oozed sex appeal and confidence.
"Trixie," I gasped in shock as I took in my reflection. "I don't look like myself anymore. I look like a whore."
Trixie chuckled before responding, "Well Patsy, let's be honest here - strippers are almost whores anyway. And the heavy makeup will disguise your appearance so no one will recognize you."
I looked in the mirror, my heart pounding in my chest. The heavy makeup did make me unrecognizable from the demure Patsy Barrett I was used to seeing. The heavy makeup, the provocative outfit - everything about this disguise screamed "stripper." As I stared at my reflection, a realization dawned on me - this could actually work.
I was grateful that Trixie was helping me get ready for my favor for Grace. Trixie's knowledge of stripping gave me a glimmer of hope that I could pull this off.
When I was almost ready to leave Trixie's house and head to the bachelor party, I called my husband to let him know I was with Trixie and would be out late. Since we live right next door, he said he would drop over to say "goodbye."
When Connor walked through the front door, his eyes widened in surprise when he saw me standing there, dressed and made up like a whore.
I blushed furiously, feeling the heat rise in my cheeks. I expected Connor to be angry about my look, but instead, he greeted me with love and pride - without judgment.
"You look incredible," he continued, stepping closer to me. "That outfit suits you more than you know."
His words sent a shiver down my spine as I relished the thrill of being desired by my own husband.
"Can I take a photo?" Connor asked, pulling out his phone.
I hesitated for a moment before nodding. The thought of this image being captured forever made me feel vulnerable and exposed. But then again, why not? There were already so many photos of me on Facebook wearing even less clothing than this outfit. What was one more?
"Sure," I replied with forced enthusiasm while striking a pose for him.
Connor grinned as he snapped several shots from different angles. "These are going straight on Facebook!" he declared proudly. "Gotta show our friends and family how brave you are."
Embarrassment washed over me like an icy wave at the thought of our loved ones seeing these intimate photos of me dressed like this - their innocent Patsy Barrett transformed into an audacious seductress for all to see. But I knew his photos of me always got him the most likes and friend requests.
"I'm glad you like it," I said with a kiss.
Trixie handed me one of her coats to wear over my stripper outfit until after I entered the party.
After her having me walk around in public in my stripper outfit, she wanted me to cover up when I was finally going to be stripping?
"But why cover up just to take off the coat?" I asked, puzzled.
Trixie rolled her eyes playfully at my naiveté. "Oh, bestie," she said, "taking off clothes is kind of the whole point of stripping."
A blush crept up my cheeks as embarrassment flooded over me once again. How did I not realize such an obvious fact? But then again, being oblivious seemed to be one of my specialties lately.
I thanked God for having Trixie to guide me through this. Her support meant more than she would ever know.
"You're going back out, beautiful?" Connor asked curiously.
I nodded. "Yeah. It's uhh, a girl's night thing."
He chuckled and pressed a gentle kiss on my cheek. "Well then, go have fun."
I felt more confident when I slipped into the long coat and covered up my revealing attire.
I kissed Connor goodbye, leaving a smudge of my bright red lipstick on his mouth.
Taking a deep breath, I declared "Alright, let's do this."
Trixie drove me to the hotel where the bachelor party was being held. As we stepped out of the car, I couldn't help but feel a rush of nervousness wash over me. The coat I wore barely concealed my stripper outfit, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that everyone around could somehow see right through it.
We made our way into the hotel lobby. I tried to act casual as we walked past the front desk. My heart pounded in my chest as I imagined what would happen if someone caught a glimpse of what lay beneath this flimsy disguise. The thought alone sent shivers down my spine.
Trixie led me towards the elevators, her confident stride contrasting with my hesitant steps. We entered an elevator packed with people, their curious glances making me squirm under their scrutiny.
Trixie gave me a reassuring smile as we rode the elevator up to the floor where the bachelor party was being held. I clutched onto my coat, feeling like it was barely concealing my scandalous attire underneath. The nervousness bubbling inside me threatened to consume my every thought.
I couldn't help but wonder how exactly this night would unfold. Would Grace's fiance recognize me? And most importantly, would I be able to carry out my role as Grace's spy?
The elevator doors opened and Trixie and I stepped out into a hallway filled with laughter and loud music. The sound reverberated through every inch of my body, heightening both my excitement and anxiety.
We followed the sounds towards a room at the end of the corridor - undoubtedly where all the action was taking place.
Trixie stopped in front of a door decorated with tacky streamers and a sign that read "Andrew's Bachelor Party." She turned to face me with a grin on her face.
"Well, bestie," she said, "this is it. Are you ready to unleash your inner vixen?"
I bit my lip, unsure if I could truly go through with this charade. But then again, I had come this far for Grace's sake. With a sigh of resignation tinged with determination, I nodded at Trixie.
"I'll do whatever it takes," I replied defiantly. "Even if it means pretending to be someone else for a night."
Trixie grinned before giving me one last piece of advice.
"Remember Patsy, confidence is key here. Just own it and make those men drool over you."
With those words lingering in my mind like an anthem of empowerment mixed with trepidation, I took a deep breath and pushed open the door to Andrew's bachelor party.
A wave of loud laughter and rowdy cheers greeted me as I stepped into the hotel room. My heart raced in my chest as I scanned the room, taking in the sea of eager faces.
I stood in the middle of the room, feeling a mix of nervousness and uncertainty wash over me. All eyes were on me now, waiting for my next move. It felt like a spotlight was trained directly on me.
One man stepped forward, his grin wide and welcoming. "Hi there," he said. "What's your name?"
I knew I couldn't use my real name, so I blurted out without thinking, "Patty Garrett."
I cringed. Some clever spy I was being.
"Nice to meet you, Patty," he said before turning to his friends. "Looks like we've got ourselves some entertainment tonight!"
The men erupted into enthusiastic applause and whistles as they egged each other on for more excitement. Someone turned on a stereo and Simply Irresistible echoed through the room. The men's chants filled the air: "Strip! Strip! Strip!"
I felt a strange sense of relief when I knew what was expected of me - stripping was something familiar in this unfamiliar world.
With trembling hands, I untied the belt of my coat and let it fall to the floor. The room erupted in hoots and whistles, fueling a newfound confidence within me.
As the men cheered for me, their enthusiasm pushing me forward, I grew bolder with each passing moment. My body moved to the rhythm of the music, swaying sensually to its seductive beat.
I was proud that these young men found a woman like me - someone their mothers' age - to be sexy. It was an unexpected boost to my ego, knowing that, even at this age, I could still captivate attention and ignite desire.
With each step I took across the room, my hips swayed provocatively. My movements exuded an air of confidence that belied any hesitation or reluctance within me. As the music pulsed through my body, I let go of any inhibitions and allowed myself to embrace the role of a seductive temptress, giving these men what they craved.
The music pulsed through as I danced sexier than ever before. As Robert Palmer sang, I truly felt simply irresistible. Every twist and turn sent waves of pleasure coursing through both myself and those watching from their seats. The energy in the room intensified with every article of clothing that fell away from my body.
I stripped off my clothes one by one as if shedding layers of inhibitions along with them. Each garment became a prop in this erotic dance - tossed around the room or handed over to eager hands.
But as the song reached its climax, so did my hesitation. My heart raced with uncertainty as I realized what came next - removing my bra. It was one thing to tease, but baring myself in front of a room full of strangers?
I paused with my bra half off, holding it and my breasts in my hands. But then I remembered why I was here - for Grace's sake.
With a deep breath, I pushed aside my reservations and tossed my bra aside. The room erupted into applause and wolf whistles as they caught sight of my bare breasts on full display.
"Fuck yeah!" one man shouted amidst the chaos.
I couldn't help but roll my eyes at his crude enthusiasm while maintaining a facade of sultry confidence.
My hesitation was gone for now, replaced by a strange mix of adrenaline and pride. As the room erupted in cheers and applause, I knew there was no turning back. I took a deep breath, embracing the boldness that had taken hold of me while deep down, all I wanted was to retreat into anonymity -- away from these gazes that reduced me to nothing more than a sexual object for their amusement.
With a seductive sway of my hips, I slowly slipped off my panties and stepped out of them. The air felt electric against my bare skin as I stood naked in high heels in front of a crowd of excited strangers.
I scanned the room, unsure of what to do next. My mind raced with thoughts of how to maintain this facade and keep up the performance. The room buzzed with anticipation as they ogled me, their eyes devouring every inch of my exposed body.
As flashes from countless cameras filled the room, with a nervous giggle, I decided to strike a pose. Pushing out my tits, arching my back just enough to accentuate the curve of my ass, I reveled in the attention showered upon me. These men were captivated by this middle-aged woman who dared to bare it all for their entertainment.
When a man handed me a vibrator, a blush crept up my cheeks. My embarrassment mixed with a strange sense of arousal as I nervously posed with the toy in hand.
As their cheers grew louder and more insistent, urging me on for more explicit acts, doubt began gnawing at the edges of my mind once again. Was this really what Grace had intended when she asked me to spy on her fiance? To become nothing more than an object for these strangers' pleasure?
But she had asked and I had accepted and I had to go through with it.
I took a deep breath, pushing aside my reservations once again. I decided to play along with their outrageous requests. They were hungry for more, and I was about to give them exactly what they wanted.
Nervously at first, I began incorporating the vibrator into my performance. The vibrations against my skin sent waves of pleasure through my body, heightening both my excitement and trepidation. Each pose became more explicit than the last, pushing the boundaries of what I thought I was capable of.
The room erupted in cheers and catcalls as they urged me on for even more daring acts. Their demands grew bolder as inhibitions were shed like discarded clothing. And amidst it all, something unexpected happened - the masturbation started making me genuinely aroused.
A mix of shame and exhilaration coursed through me as desire fueled each movement. I found myself showing off even more willingly now - doing anything they asked without hesitation or reluctance. It was a surreal experience - being watched by so many strangers while embracing this newfound liberation within myself.
I wasn't just pretending to be a stripper tonight; I had become one in every sense of the word.
The room buzzed with anticipation as they snapped photos, capturing my every obscene act. I realized that these photos would inevitably end up on the internet, forever accessible to anyone who stumbled upon them. I was just glad they did not know my real name to tag them with. Let everyone think Patty Garrett was a slut.
The crowd parted and a man my age was brought forward. I paused in mid pose, the vibrator deep in my pussy.
"Patty, this here is the bachelor. Treat him right."
It was Andrew, Grace's fiance. My heart stopped for a second, but he gave no sign of recognition and I hoped my slutty makeup had fooled him.
The men around us egged me on, their voices filled with lustful anticipation. "Patty, give him a blow job for $100!" one shouted, followed by a chorus of cheers and laughter.
It was at that moment that it hit me - a real stripper would want the money and do it without thinking twice.
I hesitated for just a moment, my mind racing with conflicting thoughts. But to keep up this charade that Grace had unknowingly thrust upon me, I needed to do it.
Reluctantly I accepted my fate. I knew that tonight, in this fancy hotel room surrounded by these men eager for release, I would become the whore that I looked like.
I dropped to my knees in front of Andrew. The room erupted into cheers and applause as they watched, waiting for the show to begin.
My hand trembled as it reached for his belt buckle while the crowd erupted into raucous applause and crude remarks. I undid his pants and pulled them down with his underwear.
I took him in my mouth slowly at first, savoring the taste of his arousal mingling with saliva. His hands tangled in my hair as he moaned in pleasure above me.
I was proud of my blow jobs - it was a skill I had perfected over the years, and my husband loved them. As I continued to suck Andrew's cock, my expert mouth worked its magic. Andrew's moans grew louder and his hips bucked uncontrollably.
Just as he was about to reach his climax, he suddenly pulled out of my mouth. Hot spurts of cum shot across my face. The room erupted into cheers.
I closed my eyes tightly against the humiliation but accepted it as part of the role I had chosen to play tonight. If they wanted whore, then they were going to get one!
I stayed on my knees, naked and vulnerable, cum dripping down my face. The room was filled with a mix of anticipation and lust as I announced the price for more blow jobs.
"Alright, gentlemen," I said, my voice trembling. "It's gonna be $200 for each blowjob."
I couldn't believe the words had come out of my mouth. Part of me was proud of my ability to pretend to be a whore. Part of me hoped that the high price would deter them from wanting one, but to my surprise, a line quickly formed. Men with their hard cocks out and cash in their hands.
One by one, the men stepped forward. They were eager and ready for what they had paid for - my expert mouth wrapped around their shafts.
I was determined to give each man the best blow job he had ever experienced. After all - they had paid for it. Fortunately, I like doing it, and I love the taste of cum!
I took each cock into my mouth and my lips and tongue worked tirelessly along their lengths as moans filled the air and obscenities spilled from their mouths. They didn't hold back either - spraying hot spurts of cum across my face, hair, and tits.
I wasn't just a stripper now, but also a whore willing who catered to men's desires without question or complaint.
The line seemed never-ending as more men stepped forward, eagerly awaiting their turn. And despite any lingering hesitation or reluctance within me, I pushed through it all because this was what they wanted - what they had paid for. And I was doing this for my friend Grace.
So there I remained on my knees like a true whore, pleasuring these men until they were spent.
At that point, I thought I was done. But just as I exhaled in relief, the men started lining up again. To my surprise, their cocks were hard once more. These were young men who had plenty of stamina. They weren't satisfied with just one round; they wanted more.
Then they asked a question that caught me off guard.
"How much to fuck you?" one of them asked, his voice filled with anticipation.
My heart raced and I hesitated for a moment, not wanting to go further but wanting to maintain my disguise as a whore. I decided to set the price outrageously high. "Hmm," I said nervously, "it's gonna be $500."
The room erupted in excitement and laughter at my response. The next question made me even more nervous.
"Is that for your pussy or your ass?" another man shouted from the crowd.
My mind raced as I considered my options, realizing that this decision would shape the course of this depraved evening. With an uneasy gulp, I replied, "The $500 is for my pussy, but it's gonna cost you $1000 if you want to fuck my ass."
It wasn't an amount that rolled off my tongue easily; it felt outrageous. But instead of being deterred by the price tag, the men cheered and held out their wads of cash again. I couldn't help but be amazed by their willingness to pay so much for a mature woman like myself.
A part of me felt proud that they found me so desirable, while another part of me was humiliated by my selling my body as a whore. But there was no turning back now. I had made the decision to go undercover as Patty Garrett - the stripper spy who would do whatever it took to uncover the truth about Grace's fiance. And so, with newfound resolve mixed with lingering hesitation and reluctance deep within me, I prepared myself mentally for what was about to come next.
The first man in line stepped forward, his cock already rock hard. My heart raced as he laid me back on an ottoman and positioned himself between my legs. I braced myself as he pushed his cock into my wet pussy.
His thrusts were relentless, pounding into me with an intensity that left me breathless. Each thrust sent shockwaves of ecstasy coursing through every fiber of my being. My pussy clenched around his cock, desperate for more.
As one man pounded into me relentlessly, another took position in front of me. I took his throbbing cock into my mouth without hesitation. I started to suck greedily while being fucked mercilessly from behind.
But it didn't end there. A third man approached from behind, his hands gripping my hips as he lined up his thick cock with my tight asshole. I winced at the initial pain and a gasp escaped my lips as he filled me completely, stretching me to my limits. A moan escaped my lips as I surrendered to the mixture of pain and pleasure that surged through my body.
Their hands roamed freely across my body, gripping my hips, squeezing my breasts and pulling my hair. I realized that this was what I had become - a vessel for their pleasure. I closed my eyes tightly against the overwhelming sensations that washed over me - pleasure mingled with pain, desire mixed with shame. Each thrust brought us closer to a climax until finally, one by one, they pulled out of my holes and sprayed cum all over my body.
I lay there, panting and covered in their sticky release, feeling a mixture of satisfaction and shame wash over me. This wasn't how I had envisioned my life turning out - pretending to be a whore for the sake of a friend.
But damn it, I was so close to an orgasm. It had been building within me like a ticking time bomb, ready to explode with pleasure. With a shy smile plastered on my face, I called out for more men to fuck me.
Without missing a beat, another man stepped forward. I was disappointed when he plunged his cock into my asshole. I begged for a cock in my pussy and another man volunteered. Then there was a cock in my mouth and I could talk no more.
The gangbang continued - one after another - each man claiming his turn to ravage my willing body. My body had become a playground for their desires, and mine. Cocks filled my every orifice; my mouth sucking greedily on swollen cocks while others pounded into me relentlessly. The room echoed with grunts mixing with moans until it all blurred together into a symphony of debauched pleasure.
They sprayed cum all over my body. Hot streams landing on my face, breasts, stomach - marking me as theirs in this debauched display. And deep down inside, a part of me relished being their willing plaything.
Orgasm after orgasm ripped through me - waves crashing over the shore of pleasure again and again until I lost count of time itself. As they pounded away at me with unrestrained enthusiasm, the hours seemed to blur together in a haze of raw desire and primal need.
At last, I had satisfied every man completely with my body and the gangbang came to an end.
My body dripped with cum from head to toe. In order to see through the mess on my face, I wiped away the cum from my eyes and licked it off my fingers. I now saw men taking photos and filming my escapades. I knew those photos would end up on the internet - forever immortalizing this moment of degradation that I had willingly subjected myself to.
But I was proud that I had fooled them all into thinking I was a whore. I knew Trixie and Grace would be proud of me.
And the taste of their cum was like an addictive elixir and I wanted more. As I said, I love the taste of cum. The room erupted in cheers as they watched me wipe cum off of my body and lick it off my fingers.
Overwhelmed by their enthusiasm, a mischievous idea sparked within me. With a seductive smile plastered on my face, I held up my breasts and licked cum off each nipple provocatively. The men went wild, their cheers growing louder as they witnessed my display. For once, I loved being the center of attention, basking in their adoration.
But deep down inside, part of me wondered how far I was willing to go for the sake of this investigation. How much more degradation could I endure?
But then again, who was I kidding? This was what needed to be done to uncover the truth about Grace's fiance - even if it meant subjecting myself to these degrading acts time and time again.
With a renewed purpose, I posed in the sluttiest positions imaginable - arching my back, pushing out my chest, my body glistening with sweat and cum.
The men eagerly clicked away on their cameras or cellphones, capturing every inch of my exposed flesh. I spread my legs wide open with cum dripping down my thighs and an impish grin plastered on my face - I knew no pose was too scandalous for a whore.
When the cheering died down, I felt guilty and embarrassed that I could no longer hold their attention. I should have been glad it was over, but I was caught up in the moment and my role and addicted to the attention.
"Watch this," I called out in my most seductive voice.
The room was filled with a mixture of excitement and anticipation as I reached for the table nearby. Grabbing a couple of dildos, I held them up for everyone to see. The crowd erupted into cheers and whistles as they anticipated what would come next.
Without hesitation, I inserted one dildo into my dripping wet pussy while using another to tease my tight asshole. The sensation sent shivers down my spine as pleasure coursed through every fiber of my being.
I fucked myself with abandon, losing myself in the moment. The men cheered even louder at this display of self-indulgence - reveling in the sight of a whore who knew exactly what she wanted.
Their cameras clicked rapidly, capturing each thrust and moan from different angles. They were documenting every dirty detail.
As orgasm approached like an unstoppable force within me, I could feel myself teetering on the edge. But just before I came, one of the men called out "It's almost time to go home."
My mind a haze of lust on the brink of orgasm, I looked at him, puzzled by his words. Home? Wasn't this my home now? The world of undercover investigation had taken me into uncharted territory - a realm where I had willingly embraced my inner whore. But reality came crashing back in like an unwelcome guest crashing a party. Like a housewife at a bachelor party, I thought.
As I stood there trembling with lust, on the verge of an orgasm I desperately wanted, my body covered in cum and sweat, the men began to dress themselves. It felt strange, seeing them clothed after witnessing their naked hunger just moments ago. The room that was once filled with moans and groans now echoed with the sound of zippers being pulled up and buttons being fastened. I watched as they transformed from ravenous beasts back into regular men, hiding their desires beneath layers of fabric.
I wanted to finish myself off with the vibrator but it felt wrong now. I was no longer a stripper, no longer a whore. The party was over.
But before I could fully process this shift in atmosphere, a man taking photos approached me. He had been capturing every dirty detail throughout the evening, documenting our debauchery for eternity.
"Sweetheart, you were amazing tonight. Truly the best whore I've ever had."
A mix of pride and humiliation washed over me all at once. It was both thrilling and disconcerting to be praised for something so taboo.
"I. Thank you," I mumbled awkwardly, unsure how else to respond.
"Hey," he said with a grin on his face, "how about we take some pictures together? You know, to remember this unforgettable night."
I hesitated for a moment, unsure if it was such a good idea. But then again, what harm could come from posing for more photos while naked and dripping with cum? At least I wouldn't be getting fucked in these photos.
As he held up his camera, I tried to summon my inner seductress once again. I arched my back provocatively while biting my lip suggestively - all the classic moves. His camera clicked repeatedly as we posed together amidst the mundane dressing and tidying up that surrounded us.
Then other men waited in line, eager to have their moment with me. I hesitated, feeling a mix of reluctance and exhaustion. But who was I to deny them the opportunity to capture this unforgettable night? Reluctantly, I stepped next to each man as they wrapped their arms around my cum-covered body. I made sure to put a smile on my face, even though, deep down, I felt a twinge of guilt knowing that these photos would forever immortalize this depraved side of me.
As I posed naked and covered in cum next to man after man, a clever plan formed in my mind. What better evidence against Andrew than to get a photo together? But not just any photo - one that would expose his true nature.
"Hey bachelor," I said in my best seductive voice. "How about I take a selfie with the man of the night?"
I positioned myself next to him, ensuring that our bodies were close enough for it to seem intimate but not too obvious. My heart raced with anticipation as I held up my phone and pressed the shutter button.
"Why don't you do something special for this picture?" I hoped my voice dripped with seduction.
I guided his hand towards my glistening pussy. He knew exactly what I meant. With deft fingers, he slid his hand between my legs and began fingering my pussy right there in front of everyone.
My breath hitched as pleasure surged through every inch of my being. It wasn't just about getting off anymore; it was about proving a point -- catching him red-handed while satisfying my own desires simultaneously.
Andrew's touch was skilled and deliberate -- he knew how to make me squirm with pleasure. His fingers sent waves of pleasure coursing through every inch of my body.
For a brief moment, jealousy flared within me as I thought about Grace experiencing this same level of ecstasy with him every night. But I quickly pushed those thoughts aside, focusing instead on the pleasure coursing through my body.
My moans grew louder, filling the room as Andrew fingered me to orgasm - my most powerful one yet. My legs trembled beneath me, threatening to give way as waves of ecstasy washed over me.
I clung onto him for support, my nails digging into his arm as I fought to maintain some semblance of control. The cheers from the other men echoed in my ears. At that moment, I felt like a true whore - satisfying their every whim while indulging in my own carnal desires.
As the last tremors of pleasure subsided, leaving me panting and spent, I felt a wave of embarrassment wash over me once again. Why did these things somehow keep happening to me?
And yet as I stood there covered in cum and sweat, having just orgasmed in front of an audience, there was no time for self-reflection or doubt; it was time to gather the evidence against Andrew.
I held up my phone. "Smile," I said.
I took several selfies of us together. We stood side by side. I was naked except for my stilettos and the glaze of cum covering my body. He was dressed immaculately with his fingers buried in my pussy.
My smile radiated triumph. These pictures would serve as evidence - proof that Andrew wasn't faithful to Grace. I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction wash over me. I had done what was asked of me - fulfilled my duty for Grace's sake.
I was startled to hear someone say "Everybody out. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here."
Home. The word hung heavy in the air. Soon I would no longer be the whore Patty Garrett, but just Patsy Barrett, happy homemaker. Part of me yearned for more - more debauchery, more excitement. But another part longed for familiarity and normalcy.
Then seeing men head out the door, panic surged through me as I quickly scanned the room, searching for my stripper clothes and Trixie's coat. My heart raced as I stumbled around in a desperate frenzy. Where were they? How could I have lost them?
Some guy handed me a bag full of cash, my payment for being a whore. I relaxed a tiny bit. I couldn't find Trixie's coat or my clothes, only the stilettos I had on my feet, but at least now I had the money to buy Trixie a new coat.
Then panic hit me as the realization sank in that I might have to leave this hotel room practically naked.
Someone called out again that it was time to leave.
I'd never stayed at a fancy hotel. I didn't want them to charge me for staying late or to get anyone in trouble. I was in a panic. There was no time for hesitation or reluctance. All that mattered was getting out of the room before anything bad happened.
With a sigh, I stepped out into the hallway. The few guys left in the room cheered as they watched me make my exit. I felt a last flush of pride for Patty Garrett and then returned to the humiliation of Patsy Barrett - standing in stilettos in a hotel hallway, naked except for the sticky residue covering every inch of my body. Cum dripped from my hair, face, tits, stomach, and out of my ass and pussy down my thighs.
I looked anxiously around, Trixie wasn't in the hallway waiting for me like we had planned. Or had we planned it? I didn't remember. Maybe she had waited but I had taken too long and she had left.
Nervously glancing around at the empty corridor of the hotel floor, it dawned on me that I would have to walk naked through the hotel to find Trixie. I hesitated at the thought of exposing myself so brazenly.
But then again, what did it matter? After what I had just engaged in back there--being seen naked by a few unsuspecting hotel guests seemed like nothing.
I glanced down at my naked body, still glistening with evidence of my debauchery. It seemed impossible to find any modesty now after everything that had transpired in that hotel room. With a deep breath, I steeled myself for what lay ahead and made my way towards the elevator.
I hesitated for a moment before stepping into the elevator and pushing the button for the first floor. The doors closed behind me with a soft whooshing sound as anticipation mixed with anxiety coursed through my veins.
I told myself, this was all part of being an undercover agent trying to uncover Grace's fiance's true colors. And if that meant strutting around like a nudist in a fancy hotel lobby filled with unsuspecting guests, so be it. But really, I was embarrassed and nervous.
With each passing floor on our descent down to the ground level, I worried if I would find Trixie and would Trixie be mad that I took so long?
Finally, the elevator dinged its arrival on the first floor. The doors slid open slowly, revealing a bustling hotel lobby filled with people going about their business oblivious to what had just transpired upstairs. Everything was normal, except I was naked in high heels and covered in cum. And if it wasn't obvious I was a whore, I was holding a bag of cash.
I nervously stepped out into the hotel lobby, my heart pounding as all eyes turned towards me. It felt like time had slowed down, each gaze burning into my naked flesh and leaving me feeling exposed and vulnerable. My mind raced with thoughts of judgment and ridicule.
To my relief, Trixie's voice broke through the sea of prying eyes. "Patsy! Over here!" she called from the front desk.
A wave of gratitude washed over me as I made my way towards her, leaving a trail of dripping cum in my wake. The mixture of embarrassment and arousal still lingered within me, making every step feel both exhilarating and nerve-wracking.
When I reached Trixie's side, I apologized for taking so long at the party. "I didn't expect it to go on for so long,"
Trixie laughed, her laughter echoing through the lobby like music to my ears.
"Oh, bestie," she said between giggles, "don't worry about it! You were doing some serious undercover work there."
Relief flooded over me. It was moments like these that reminded me why we made such a great team - always having each other's backs no matter what kind of mess we found ourselves in.
But then Trixie's laughter echoed through the lobby as she revealed that she had seen everything I had done and everyone I had fucked. My heart skipped a beat and I was torn between embarrassment and doubt.
Trixie pointed to the large monitors on the wall that normally displayed the hotel's announcements. Now, instead of mundane updates about hotel amenities and events, they were showing explicit videos of me being gangbanged at the party. Me being fucked and used by multiple men, my body contorted and writhing with pleasure.
I stood frozen in shock as the explicit videos played on the monitors for everyone in the hotel lobby to see. I could feel the heat rising in my cheeks as every eye turned towards me..
My heart pounded in my chest as I scanned the crowd, searching for any sign of judgment or disgust. But to my surprise, there was none. Instead, I saw faces filled with awe and admiration - people who were captivated by the raw sexuality displayed on those screens.
"Well, well," said the desk clerk. "If it isn't the beautiful whore. I've been watching you on those screens all night." He paused for effect before continuing, his eyes lingering on my naked form covered in cum. "And I must say, you put on quite a show."
His words felt like both praise and mockery rolled into one.
Before I could even respond, he asked, "So tell me, gorgeous, can I have a turn with you?"
I eyed Trixie, silently hoping she would rescue me from this situation. To my relief, she came to my aid with an impish smile playing on her lips.
"I'm sorry," she said. "But our Patsy here needs some beauty sleep after all that hard work tonight. You'll have to wait until morning if you want to fuck her."
The desk clerk's grin widened and he said "Oh don't worry sweetheart, I can be patient."
"Thanks for that, bestie. I don't know if I could handle another fuck right now." I whispered to Trixie as we walked away. I blushed at the crudity of my language.
Trixie laughed. "I think you've done enough fucking for one night."
"Bestie," I whispered hesitantly. "Do you think he expects me to show up in the morning to fuck him?"
Trixie burst into laughter at my question, drawing curious glances from both guests and staff alike. I felt my face flush with embarrassment. She hadn't actually answered, and I was too embarrassed to ask again.
The walk out of the lobby seemed to take forever. Every step I took, I could feel the eyes of the hotel guests staring at my naked body. As I stepped out of the hotel into the crisp night air, a wave of exhaustion washed over me. It was as if every ounce of energy had been drained from my body after hours of relentless fucking and pleasure. The weight of my actions settled on my shoulders as reality sank in - my mission as a whore was complete.
Despite the lingering embarrassment and self-consciousness, I couldn't help but feel a sense of triumph. After all, I had accomplished what I set out to do - infiltrate Grace's fiance's bachelor party. I had been a successful spy.
But now it was time to go back to being Patsy Barrett, the innocent housewife. A small part of me hesitated at the thought. Would things ever be the same again? Could I simply slip back into that role without any consequences or lingering desires?
"You can't ride in my car, I don't want you getting cum on my seat," Trixie said. "Also, where's my coat?"
Standing on the sidewalk naked and covered in cum, I pleaded with Trixie to drive me home in her car.
I held out the bag of cash. "Come on, bestie. I'll pay for your car to be cleaned inside and out. And I'll buy you a new coat."
Trixie chuckled, her eyes glinting with amusement. "Get in," she said between giggles, "but just know that you'll owe me a favor for this."
"You're a lifesaver," I said as I got into the car and Trixie started up the engine.
Before I forgot my possible appointment with the desk clerk, I put an event in my phone for the morning - Fuck the desk clerk, 8:00 AM.
As I looked at my phone, I remembered the photos I had taken of Andrew, proof he was unfaithful to Grace. My mind shifted back to the mission at hand. I opened the photo gallery.
"Prepare yourself for some scandalous evidence," I said.
Triumphantly, I showed Trixie the photos.
As Trixie looked at the photos, her eyes widened in surprise and amusement. She burst into laughter again, unable to contain herself.
"Oh, bestie," she managed between fits of giggles, "you've really confused yourself this time."
I was confused as I watched Trixie's reaction. Wasn't she supposed to be shocked or angry? Instead, she seemed delighted by what she saw. "What do you mean?"
"Grace knew that Andrew was going to fuck the stripper tonight. She just wanted to make sure Andrew had a good time tonight."
She leaned closer and whispered, "She picked you because she knew you were a slut and damn good at it. And she figured you wouldn't mind being a whore for a night."
A mixture of humiliation and pride coursed through me at Trixie's words. My friend Grace thought I was the best fuck for her fiance and enough of a slut to be willing to play the role of a whore for one night. And to my shame, apparently she was right.
As we drove through the city streets towards our neighborhood, I noticed the stares from passersby as they caught sight of me sitting naked in the passenger seat next to Trixie.
My mind raced with thoughts of what awaited me when we arrived at our destination - walking naked under the streetlights past curious neighbors who were no doubt watching from their windows.
Sure enough, as we turned onto our street, I could see curtains twitching and shadows moving behind closed blinds. As we pulled up outside Trixie's house, our neighbors began peeking out their windows.
"Thanks for the ride," I said gratefully.
I gathered up some courage before I stepped out of the car. The cool night air sent shivers down my spine, making me acutely aware of my exposed state. I hurriedly took those last few steps towards my home next door, naked under the streetlights.
My husband, Connor, came out to greet me on the porch with a big smile. He took one look at my naked body, covered in cum and still dripping from every opening, and just said "welcome home, beautiful."
I blushed furiously, feeling both embarrassed and touched by his nonchalant reaction. Connor had always been open-minded when it came to my accidental adventures.
Connor waved to the watching neighbors and then took my hand in his and we finally walked into our house and closed the door.
Once inside, he pulled me into a passionate kiss. The taste of him mixed with the lingering taste of other men made my head spin with desire. Without breaking the kiss, he guided us towards the bedroom and we tumbled onto the bed in a frenzy of need and desire.
Connor's hands explored every inch of my body - tracing over each cum-soaked curve and crevice with hunger. His touch ignited electric sensations that coursed through my veins, erasing any trace of fatigue that remained from earlier encounters. His fingers found their way between my legs, slipping easily into my pussy.
"You're so wet." he groaned, his voice husky with desire. "Are you still up for more?"
"Fuck me," I demanded breathlessly. "Fuck me with your hard cock."
He didn't need any further encouragement and he thrust his cock deep inside me. Each thrust sent waves of pleasure coursing through me. My orgasms came fast and furious -- wave after wave of pleasure. Connor kept up his pace until finally he let out a moan and came inside me.
As we lay tangled together in sweaty sheets after our passionate lovemaking session, I pushed thoughts of the bachelor party aside, snuggled closer to Connor's warm body, and we drifted off to sleep.
Until my alarm went off at 8AM and I went to fuck the desk clerk.
