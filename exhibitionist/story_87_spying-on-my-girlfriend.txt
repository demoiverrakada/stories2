EVERY CHARACTER IS OVER 18 YEARS OLD
"Which bathing suit should I pack?" my girlfriend Lori asked. I stuck my head out of the bathroom. In one hand she held a modest one piece bathing suit and in the other she had what could only be described as a bikini. I couldn't help but laugh.
"I'm sure your students would love that one," I said as I pointed to the bikini. "You have no idea how lucky they are."
She gave me a puzzled look. "Why do you say that?"
"Because when I was their age, every single one of my teachers looked like they were days away from kicking the bucket. I didn't have a single young or attractive teacher," I responded. And it was true. Lori was a stunningly beautiful woman. Lori was Lebanese. Her hair was dark, and her skin was a perfect olive color. She had a beautiful body. Everywhere she went, she turned heads. Lori always denied but I told her if she wasn't a teacher she could easily have gotten into modeling.
She started to blush. "You're just saying that!" I went back into the bathroom to finish brushing my teeth before work. A few minutes later, we were sitting at the kitchen table before we both had to leave. Lori had a half day in school, but she had agreed to chaperone the senior trip. She was one of three teachers who were going to go for the weekend to a campground with the students. I went to the high school myself so I was familiar with the trip.
I glanced over at the clock on the stove. I stood up from the table and took one last swig of my coffee. "I need to get to the office." Lori stood up too. "I hope you have a good weekend. If the kids get too rowdy and you need me, you know I'm just a phone call away."
Lori smiled at me. "Thanks. But I think Amy and John and I can handle this."
"John? Really? He volunteered to go?" I choked a little on my coffee.
"The students respect John. They will listen to him," Lori responded. "Well some of them will."
I leaned in and kissed her goodbye. I was going to turn away and leave but Lori grabbed my head and kissed me a little bit more passionately. "I'm going to miss you this weekend," she whispered in my ear. Suddenly I felt her hand start to rub my cock through my khakis. "I'm really going to miss this." She yanked on it now. I let out a moan. My eyes bugged out as I watched my beautiful girlfriend drop to her knees in the kitchen. She unzipped my pants and pulled out my cock. Lori wasted no time wrapping her lips around it.
In all the time I had known her, she had never been this aggressive before. I'm not saying she was timid or shy, just never seen this side of her before. And I was enjoying it. I ran my fingers through her hair. Her eyes were closed as her mouth slid up and down on my cock. I'm usually good at holding out, but the way she was attacking my cock with her mouth I started to lose control just minutes later.
I exploded into her mouth. She did her best to swallow it all down, but I watched as some of my cum dripped off her lips. Lori stood up and wiped her mouth. She had the most mischievous grin on her face I had ever seen!
"Goodbye, baby. I'll see you on Sunday night," she said as she walked out.
___________________________________________________________________________
I had a hard time concentrating at work that day. All I could think about was my encounter with Lori before we left. I was constantly in a haze that day. But somehow I managed to get my work done. I got home late that night. I decided to take a quick shower. My mind flashed back to the kitchen. My cock instantly got hard as I remembered this morning's blowjob. I began to stroke my cock there in the shower. And for the second time in less than twenty four hours I exploded quickly.
It was at that point I knew I had to see Lori again. Like I said, I knew the campground they were staying at. The school had planned the same senior year trip every year for over twenty years. I decided that I would drive up there tomorrow morning and surprise Lori.
______________________________________________________________________________
The drive was a short thirty five minute drive. I pulled my car up alongside the two yellow school busses that were parked in the grave lot. I saw a few students as I made my way through the campground. That's when I bumped into John.
"Hey, man. What are you doing up here?" he asked with a surprised look on his face.
"Hey, John. Good to see you. I thought I would surprise Lori. Have you seen her lately?" I asked as I looked around. John thought for a minute.
"Yeah, I think I saw her and Amy heading up to the swimming hole a few minutes ago. You might find her there," John responded. I nodded my head.
"Thanks. I appreciate it." I turned around and smiled at him. I took off sprinting down the trail that led down to the swimming area. It wasn't a long hike either. Just ten minutes after I left John I could already hear voices out in the distance.
I heard four distinct voices among the splashing. One of them I recognized easily as my girlfriend Lori. I heard another female's voice. I had met Amy several times so I knew her voice. But I also heard two male voices. However I could tell you I had never heard those voices before. I moved as silently as I could down the path until I could see the dock. Instantly my jaw dropped. Lori must have switched bathing suits because instead of wearing the one piece modest suit she told me she was going to wear, she was wearing the other one.
Standing next to her I saw Amy as well. One of the males I heard was bobbing in the water. Lori sat on the dock, playfully kicking her feet into the water, splashing the man who was swimming.
I knelt down in behind a tree just a few hundred feet from the dock, which gave me a great vantage point. There was something about this scene that I just didn't want to disturb.
"Knock it off!" I heard the man in the water growl at Lori. She just laughed as she kicked her feet again.
"What are you going to do about it?" she playfully laughed. I watched as he swam between her legs, his fingers grasping at her thighs as he pulled himself up a little bit. His face was just inches away from her breasts.
"I know what I would like to do about it," he replied. Lori pushed his face away as he fell back into the water.
"Behave!"
"Why should he? We all know he's been fucking you all semester!", Amy muttered. I couldn't believe it. My heart just dropped.
"Like you and Lucas haven't been fucking that entire time either," Lori responded. Another man emerged from the locker room behind Amy. He had short brown hair. He was wearing a black bathing suit without a shirt. I watched as he wrapped his arms around Amy from behind. He started kissing her neck quickly.
I was still in shock. Lori didn't deny what Amy accused her of. There was a part of me that felt like storming off. There was a part of me that wanted to watch what happened next. Ultimately that's what won out.
"And if I do remember, you ladies promised us something here today," Lucas said. His hands moved from Amy's waist to her breasts, groping her through her bathing suit.
"You didn't think we were serious, did you?" Lori said, her eyes bouncing back from the guy in the lake to Lucas and Amy.
"Oh, we were serious. So it's time for you two to pay up," the guy in the water said. He pulled himself up on the dock. Suddenly I noticed he wasn't even wearing a bathing suit. His ass was in full view of me. "So what are you two waiting for?" He lifted Lori up from her seated position. In the mean time Lucas was pushing Amy towards Lori. "Come on, girls."
Lucas released his grip on Amy. The two women stood inches apart from each other. "This can't be happening," I thought to myself. They giggled nervously. I watched as Lori shrugged her shoulders. She moved closer and gave Amy a quick peck on the lips.
The man that was in the water walked between them. "No, that's not what we agreed on, now was it?" he said firmly. He grabbed Amy's head with his left hand and Lori's with his right hand. He pushed their heads together. Before my eyes I saw my beautiful girlfriend making out with her best friend. Their kisses got deeper. I could see their mouths open. Lucas moved back behind Amy and the naked man was now pushing his hardening cock against Lori's ass. He took Lori's hands from Amy's waist and moved them to her breasts. I couldn't believe she started groping at her best friend like that. Lori had never mentioned an interest in women before. But judging by what I was seeing before my own eyes, there was a lot to Lori that I didn't know.
"Fuck, this is so hot," Lucas moaned. It was Amy's turn now to start groping at Lori's breasts as well. I hated to agree with him, but it was. Amy and Lori were kissing like long lost lovers who had gone years apart. They seemed to be melting into each other's kisses. I should have been angry or upset. But my body was betraying me. I felt my cock harden as I watched my girlfriend kissing another woman while her lover pressed his body against her tight ass. I watched from a distance as her mouth opened to her friend, while their hands grabbed and groped each other.
Amy reached back and started to fondle Lucas' cock. Lucas suddenly grabbed Amy, twirled her around and picked her up. He carried her into the bathroom that was behind them. Lori turned around and faced her lover.
"I bet you liked watching me with Amy, didn't you?" She teased. Her hand reached down and started to stroke his cock.
"Judging by what I saw, you were enjoying it too." he replied back. Suddenly, he peeled her bikini top off her shoulders. It fell to the ground. He bent forward and started sucking on her breasts. Lori grasped the back of his head. A moan escaped her lips.
"Maybe a little," she moaned. "Fuck, baby. you're turning me on!"
"That's kind of the point," he replied before returning his mouth to her hardening nipple. By this point my cock was painfully erect. The man grasped her shoulders and forced her to her knees suddenly. Lori grinned as she went willingly. "Show me how much I'm turning you on."
My girlfriend took her second cock in her mouth that day. She was sucking him like a pro. Her head bobbed up and down on him. He tangled her hair around his fingers as he watched her. She deep throated his big cock. Back and forth, back and forth her head moved. I watched as she took the entire length of his cock down her throat.
Something shifted my attention suddenly. Behind them I saw a hand appear from inside the bathroom. It was just momentarily there as it dropped Amy's bathing suit on the ground. A grin appeared on my face. I could only imagine what was going on back there. Instead I just focused on what I could see. And that's my girlfriend sucking another man's cock.
I'm not into guys at all, but I couldn't help but admire the size of his dick. I never considered myself to have a small one, but compared to this guy? I was starting to feel very subconscious. My hand reached into my pants and began to stroke myself. I couldn't believe I was as turned on as I was watching my girlfriend cheat on me.
She continued to deep throat him. Her head bobbed up and down. His eyes were closed as his hands grasped the back of her head. I could hear her gagging on his big cock. She glanced up at him with his cock still in her mouth.
"Do you suck your boyfriend's cock this good?" he hissed.
"No, he's not nearly as big as you."
The man forced her up to her feet quite forcefully. He kissed her passionately. She was too willing to kiss him back. I watched as he ripped her bikini bottoms down her legs. Lori stepped out of them as he slid a finger inside her.
"And I bet he doesn't make you this wet, does he?"
"No. Not even close."
A second finger slipped inside her. I heard her let out a moan as his fingers slid in and out of her. They kissed again passionately as they mashed their bodies against each other. She reached for his cock and wrapped her hand around it. From behind them I could hear the sounds of moaning coming from the shower. There's no doubt in my mind what was happening there. But I was focusing on what I could see.
"I'm glad I stayed back a year," the man said to her.
"And why's that?" she asked innocently.
"Because then I could fuck you. I saw how you looked at me. You wanted me from the moment I stepped in your class. You just had to wait until I was old enough,"
"I did. I admit it. I wanted you inside me. I wanted you to fuck me. I wanted you to make me your slut. Waiting for you to become legal was the hardest thing I had to do," she responded. I had never heard her use that language before. There was something about him that seemed to bring out the animal in her. "Fuck me, Derek."
So his name was Derek. Well anyway I watched as Derek pushed Lori down onto the dock. Her legs spread wide. He climbed on top of her suddenly. There was nothing soft or gentle about the way he slid in her. They fucked like animals. She began to scratch at his back. She let out a throaty moan as he pounded into her. Amy appeared naked in the doorway. She watched as Derek fucked Lori.
I couldn't help looking back and forth between them. My cock was painfully hard as I watched my girlfriend begging to be fucked. And from what I was seeing she was getting just what she wanted. Derek was thrusting into her. My gaze shifted to Amy. Her fingers were slowly sliding in and out of her pussy as she watched her best friend. This whole scene was so surreal.
Lori had wrapped her legs around his body. They kissed passionately as he thrusted faster into her. I could hear her moaning. I had no doubt that she was cumming repeatedly. Lori never had any trouble orgasming. My eyes moved back to Amy. She had moved closer to the couple. Derek must have noticed her as well. A grin appeared on his face.
"I think we've attracted an audience," he moaned. For a second I was concerned that he meant me. When she realized she had been spotted, Amy moved closer. She got closer to Lori. They kissed again, this time showing no hesitation. Derek watched in amazement. Suddenly he let out a guttural moan. He exploded deep inside Lori's wet pussy.
Derek slid his cock out of her, which allowed Lori to sit up. She embraced Amy in a passionate kiss. I heard some other noises coming from behind me. I thought to myself this would probably be a good time for me to leave.
I made my way back up the path and bumped into John again. "Did you see Lori?" he asked.
I let out a chuckle. "No, I guess she must have gone hiking. Listen, do me a favor? Don't tell her I was here." John shrugged his shoulders but agreed. I got back in my car and drove home.
I spent the rest of the weekend thinking about what, if anything I would say to Lori when she came home. Would I tell her what I saw? I decided against it. But I do know that I came three times that weekend picturing her with Derek. This would open up a new phase in our relationship...
