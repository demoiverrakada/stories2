*** Author's Preface ***
This is a preface by the author. It's masturbatory, but perhaps not in the way you were hoping. Please move down to Part One if you're just interested in the fiction. If you're a struggling writer like me maybe what follows will strike a chord, or at least be of minor interest. I promise it's short.

I started this work with the intention of submitting it to the annual Literotica Halloween Contest. That would be the 2016 Literotica Halloween Contest. It was supposed to be a short story.
Instead, something like 30,000 words poured out of me over the course of a single week. The Muse was with me, and my usual writing rock fight had been replaced by a bountiful torrent of ideas AND the wherewithal to turn them into consecutive complete sentences.
When I stopped to catch my breath, I realized it was barely the first act. Nothing like this had ever happened to me before. I was writing my first novel.
The taps remained reasonably open for the next six months, and I powered through to about 70,000 words. Sometimes I would write 3,000 in a day. Sometimes barely 300, but it kept coming. I had outlines. I had beginnings, middles and endings. I had clever little lines of dialogue jotted down. I had IT, whatever it is the Muse grants.
And then it was gone.
***
I told myself life got in the way. I got a promotion. I bought a new house. I got a divorce. I changed jobs.
I did not write.
I fell into a depression. I hated my new job. I drank too much. I was searching for apartments. I was dating again.
I still did not write. I thought about finishing my novel all the time; it was pretty much 90% done! I told anyone who asked that I wanted to be a writer: my family, my friends, my girlfriends, my therapist. But I did not write.
I found a new job and quit the one I hated. I took a sorely-needed vacation, by myself, someplace quiet.
The dam broke and I wrote. I finished the novel. I knocked out 10,000 words in four days, sitting on a beach alone. I came home and fucked my girlfriend half to death.
That was October 2018, two years after I first sat down to write a short story about a spooky sex cult.
It was done! Well, mostly done. It just needed a few touches. Now that it was finished, I was going to put it through a few rounds of edits and make it "good."
The novel sat untouched for six months.
***
The new job was worse than the old job. Much worse. Depression, drinking, dating - the familiar phantom obstacles all made new appearances . I was miserable again.
I did not write. But I knew that I could write, and then that I should write, and - eventually - that I must write.
So last month I quit that job too. I do not think I'll go back to an office job ever again.
Now I'm freelancing, consulting and writing. I wish I had made the move years ago, but I probably wasn't ready. I'm ready now.
I'm taking one business day each week to work on personal projects. First up: get this fucking spooky sex cult novel out of the fucking door.
***
I don't know if it's "good" after the few touches I've made. I think it's "better" and that will have to do. This thing took 2.75 years, most of which was wasted time spent not writing. It's time to move on to new things.
So here it is, my first novel. It was an enormous struggle. Now I know I can do it.
This one is for me.

*** Part One ***
Sam sat in his cramped cubicle, hunched over his desk, jotting down the notes while managing editor Marty Barnes gave the last bit of his rah-rah speech somewhere behind him.
"Remember our jobs are to watch the watchmen, to shine light where there is none, and to inform and delight our readers," Sam mouthed to himself, delivering each a half second before Barnes.
The fact was the Monday story meeting for the metro section of the paper essentially ran on autopilot. Reporters talked through their stories with each other while Sam Stone, associate Metro editor, took notes on how the section was shaping up and began to think about layout, art, headlines and online interactive.
It had taken years, but Sam felt like he finally had worked himself up to running the section, despite the bullshit 'associate' tag in front of his title. Barnes didn't actually pay attention during the meetings, so the reporters didn't actually care about his advice - the whole thing was a waste of time.
Sam hoped it hadn't gone unnoticed either; the higher-ups had announced a new assistant editor position on the paper's investigative team. Sam had applied, and rumor was he was actually in the running for the job - or at least get a spot on the team. It was nice recognition, theoretically, but not something he could really dwell on; there was another paper every day and he had more than enough work to keep his attention. Still, he had a good feeling that things would shake favorably for him, and frankly it was his dream job.
Eric, the long-time cops and courts reporter who had taken over the beat from Sam himself, finished his last note about another murder/suicide, the third in as many months in town. This time it involved two local celebrities - the headmaster at the preeminent private school in the area was shot by the owner of a popular downtown nightclub, who had then turned the gun on herself. It was darkly scandalous - both victims were married to other people.
Things had been a little exciting lately in town; Eric thought it was a mix of school anxiety starting back up, the economy transferring from summer to holiday, and the full moon.
"Okay everyone, do your best work today," Barns said, closing the meeting, a half second after Sam had mouthed the same thing. "Stone, I expect to see the expense reports by end of day tomorrow."
Barnes turned and walked away without waiting for a response. As the reporters started to get up, Sam spoke for the first time that morning: "Don't forget to think about art and make sure you give the designers plenty of notice if you need a homemade graphic. Tomorrow you should all have story pitches for the Sunday paper. Lily, hold back a second, I've got something for you to do."
The reporters cleared out of the area around his cubicle and wheeled their chairs off to their own cubes. The relative calm of his corner of the floor devolved once again into the controlled chaos of the newsroom. Lily stood up, smoothed her knee-length pencil skirt, and bounced over to his desk. She opened her notepad to a new page and looked at him eagerly.
"Okay Lily, you've been with us full-time for a few weeks, are you ready to go find me a Sunday story?" Sam asked.
"Yes sir! Whatever you need, I'm your gal," Lily said, pencil poised over paper. "Do you need someone to help Eric with the murder/suicide?"
"What I need is something for Halloween on Sunday," Sam said, and he watched Lily deflate ever so slightly. "I know, you think it's fluff, but people read fluff. That's not even what I want. This is a chance for you to go out and find me something fun or interesting and turn this kind of fluff on its head. I don't want '10 pumpkin-flavored foods for Fall,' get me something about ghosts or ghouls or something."
"Murders are ghoulish, why don't I work with Eric to ... " Lily started.
"Eric has covered many murders without the help of enthusiastic cub reporters," Sam said, smiling a little. "If you want to work on something about 'crimes of passion' as a theme, now we might be getting somewhere, but leave the details of this specific murder up to Eric. He won't want you underfoot. He's ... grumpy ... and won't want a puppy nipping at his heels."
"Yes sir! I'll start looking into passion right away!" Lily said, then her eyes went wide. "Uh ... I mean crimes of passion, sir. Passion is, uh, different."
"Please stop calling me sir, Lily. I'm an editor, not a drill sergeant," Sam said. "Show me what you've got Thursday morning; final version is due Friday, with art included."
Lily nodded, turned and started to bound away, but caught herself and slowed down to a very professional speed walk. She looked over her shoulder at Sam and smiled self-consciously.
Sam smiled back, nodded and then spun to his computer. He'd barely moved the mouse when an instant message chimed in.
Miranda: 'Hitting on the skintern again? Not very professional of you.'
Sam grinned.
Sam: 'We actually brought her on full time after the summer. Her outfit isn't near the worst we've had; if by "hitting on" you mean "patiently enduring," then yes. And I won't be taking advice on professionalism from a muckraking gadfly like you.'
Sam poked his head up above the cubicle wall. Across the room he could see Miranda's straw colored hair, up in her iconic bun affixed with pens, shaking with laughter.
Miranda: 'She's cute'
Sam: 'She's waaay too young for me, plus, you know, Viv might have something to say about it. As would HR.'
Miranda: 'Viv better watch out ... you're not too old for her. She's in awe of you, you can see it in her wide doe eyes.'
Sam: 'Like the way Barnes looks at you?'
Miranda: 'Gross. Barnes looks at all women like that, he's a perv.'
Sam: 'Anything cooking this week for our paper's intrepid socialite?'
Miranda: 'I think so; scored an invite to a party tonight hosted by a mysterious newcomer to high society.'
Sam: 'Mysterious newcomer?'
Miranda: 'Did you know somebody bought the Van Hooten house?'
Sam: 'Victorian wreck way out in the hills? I thought it was about to be condemned...'
Miranda: 'Me too, but I was out taking daddy's convertible for its last pre-winter hurrah this weekend and the place is all fixed up. Like, gorgeous. This morning I went to the city clerk's office to see who bought it ... sure enough, an out-of-towner named Luc Mane did ... paid cash.'
Sam: 'Cash?!? And it's already all fixed up?'
Miranda: 'That's not even the best part ... just as I was talking to Connie the assistant clerk about it ... the guy walked right into the office, so Connie introduced us! He's the tall, dark, European, rich and handsome type.'
Sam: 'oh god ...'
Miranda: 'When he found out who I was he invited me to a private party tonight!'
Sam: 'Wow you waste no time at all do you. A party on Monday night?'
Miranda: 'Neither does he I guess; he said my name would be on the list if I could make it; it would be mostly friends and business associates. He said no photog; this is just a "getting to know you" affair, not for public.'
Sam: 'There's a list?'
Miranda: 'You can't let everyday associate metro editor riffraff into these sorts of things ... '
Sam: 'lol, right. Are you bringing a date?'
Miranda: 'Please. You know I don't have time for that "dating" nonsense ;) I've yet to meet the man who can keep up with me at these things anyway.'
Sam: 'Fair enough. Have fun? Be careful?'
Miranda: 'I will.'
As 4 p.m. rolled around, Sam had the paper just about wrapped and ready to hand off to the night desk. Then the call came over the scanner; a blazing house fire on Elm Street. Sam stood up and surveyed his section; all the reporters were out on assignment.
Barnes poked his head out of his office and shouted, "Are you fucking deaf, Stone?" Sam grabbed his notebook and headed to the fire, grumbling.
On the way he texted his fiancee to tell her he'd be late.
'Again?" Viv texted back. 'Send somebody else? I made dinner.'
'Nobody else to send,' Sam texted. 'I won't be too late, but eat without me.'
When Sam arrived the fire was in full swing; he snapped some shots with his cell phone and waited for the firefighters to knock it down before finding the lieutenant for comment. It was your routine burn; unknown cause, too early to say if it was suspicious, nobody home at the time. The dog got out alive. One firefighter treated for smoke inhalation. The building was a total loss.
Sam wrote it up like he had hundreds of times before, filed, and answered the night desk's questions. He grabbed a muffin from the coffee shop and ate it in the car.
He got to Viv's apartment and opened the door with his key. He essentially lived there; he kept a hole-in-the-wall place on the other side of town to keep up appearances for Viv's very religious parents but hadn't been there in weeks.
They weren't stupid; they had to know he was sleeping there every night. But apparently keeping up appearances was important; sinning wasn't as bad as having others think you were sinning, or something like that. He wasn't religious. Besides, they were paying for Viv's spacious apartment entirely, the least he could do was not rub in their faces the fact he was fucking their only child.
"Honey, I'm home!" he said. "Good news, the dog made it out alive!"
Sam dropped his keys on the table by the door, slid his omnipresent backpack underneath it and loosened his tie. It was dark in the apartment, but there was a flickering light in the next room. Sam assumed it was the TV, but why was she watching with the sound turned off?
He strode in looking for Viv, but when he walked into the next room he saw it was a guttering candle in the center of a full spread on the dining room table. Cold but well-presented food sat on serving platters; Viv's china was set out for two, a full glass of wine at his spot on the table, hers missing.
"Uh oh," Sam muttered to himself. "Barnes may have fucked me again."
Sam grabbed his glass of wine and took a big sip, then took a deep breath, and set out to cautiously look for Viv.
The bedroom door was slightly open, and a light was on inside. Sam crept to the door and slowly pushed it open. Viv lay on the bed, reading a book. She looked up as the door swung open, and snapped her book shut.
"The dog got out alive," Sam said.
"Yeah, I heard you the first time," she said curtly. "You forgot, didn't you."
"Um, I suppose I did," Sam said. He was completely lost and shrugged apologetically. "Barnes ..."
"I don't want to hear about Barnes," Viv said, crossing her arms over her chest. "Tonight is the third anniversary of our third date. You know how special this night is for me; it's the ... "
"... first night we kissed," Sam finished. "I know. I'm so sorry, it totally slipped my mind. Why didn't you tell me you were planning something special?"
"I shouldn't have to!" Viv said, pouting. She was very cute when she pouted, Sam thought. Her freckled nose scrunched up and she pursed her full lips.
"You should know me well enough by now that I'd have your favorite meal prepared on an important night like this. We are getting married in 14 months. I don't see why you're still toiling away at that shithole job with your talent."
"I didn't see steak out there ... I mean, I'm sorry, Viv," Sam said, fumbling. "I'll make it up to you, I promise."
"You said your favorite meal is pork chops and cauliflower," Viv said. "And how are you going to make this up to me? You can't afford flowers."
"First of all, I can afford flowers," Sam said, setting down his wine and unbuttoning his shirt and tossing it to the floor. "You throw them out after less than a day when I do buy them.
"Secondly, I intend to make this up to you by reenacting our sixth date, right now," he said, giving her a wide grin.
"And what makes you think I'll let you," Viv said, seemingly unimpressed. "Especially stinking like smoke."
"Oh, I have my ways," Sam said.
He crossed the room to the bed, bent over and took her head in his hands, lightly caressing her cheek. He looked deeply into her eyes, and then kissed her full pouty lips softly.
"I love you, my darling. I'm sorry I forgot the date. I'll make you a special dinner on Thursday, anything you like," Sam said, still gently holding her face.
Viv stared back up at him, though he saw her icy demeanor thaw ever so slightly. He reached down and kissed her again, still tenderly but holding it much longer, and by the end Viv was kissing him back. Sam slid into bed next to her, and their lips met lovingly for a while. Sam reached up and brushed aside a few strands of her rich auburn hair from her eyes, and then ran his thumb on her cheekbone. He kissed her again and then started to scoot down the bed.
"Sam, I'm not ... "
"Shhhhh," Sam said, putting a finger to her lips.
He kissed her down her neck slowly to where the oversized t-shirt she wore to bed met her collar bone. He ran his fingers down her sides, outside the cotton cloth, hands roaming over her breasts and down to her hips. He could feel her nipples stiffen, and she lifted her hips ever so slightly as she sighed.
Sam took the opportunity to take the hem of her shirt and slowly peel it up and off her body, uncovering first a pair of well-worn white cotton panties, then her A cup breasts, large nipples now standing at full attention. He gently pulled the shirt over her head, and then moved in to pick up where his kisses left off.
His lips brushed her collarbone, then moved slowly down the top of her chest to her puffy nipples. He circled each of the stiff nubs with his tongue, and then sucked one, then the other, into his mouth lightly.
Viv was self-conscious about her chest, both that her breasts were small and that her nipples were so big and puffy. Sam didn't care a bit; her nipples were very sensitive and he loved to kiss and caress them to stoke her arousal.
After spending several minutes pampering her breasts with his tongue, licking and sucking her nipples and gently blowing on each one, he resumed his path down her body, kissing along her ticklish ribs and down past her belly button.
He kissed along the waist of her cotton panties from one hip to the other, while his hands roamed over her whole body, from nape of her neck, to nipples, to hips. Viv slowly raised them again, and Sam hooked his fingers into her underwear, pulling them down her slender legs and dropping them off the side of the bed.
Sam quickly pulled off his pants and underwear, freeing his straining cock to let it quiver excitedly in the open, and then moved his lips back to her hips and resumed kissing down her body. He gently ground his nose in her pubic patch and inhaled her scent deeply, then he reached out his tongue and ran it along her labia, licking in long strokes.
Viv moaned and wriggled a bit; Sam's quick glance up to her face found her eyes were closed and she was biting her lip coyly.
He lifted up her legs for better access, and gently kissed all around her pink pussy lips, carefully avoiding any contact with her clit. He took one of her lips in his mouth, sucking gently, then the other. He angled his head and forced his tongue inside of her, making circles just inside her entrance where juices now flowed freely.
Viv was moaning steadily now and breathing much quicker. Sam brought his thumbs down and ran them over her slit, stopping just shy of her button; once, twice, three times he ran each thumb broadly over her entire pussy, but not her clit.
Finally he took both thumbs and pulled her lips apart, and gave a broad lash of his tongue all the way up her pussy and onto her nub, surrounding it with his lips and sucking it into his mouth.
Viv came with a loud gasp, shaking as her juices flowed out of her. Sam lapped them up, working her whole pussy but now paying special attention to her clit on every pass.
"Oh god, don't stop," Viv groaned. "You're making me feel so good."
He took his index and middle finger of his right hand, and slowly started to work them into her pussy. He worked them in and out of her, tonguing her clit and nibbling her lips. She was in rapture.
Sam took his left hand, quickly licked his index finger, and the began to rub it gently around Viv's tight little asshole. She gasped loudly and held her breath after the first circuit; he never slowed down with his tongue or the fingers working in and out of her as he made another pass.
Sam took his finger and started to press it to her puckered ring. He heard her moan "Nuh uh" and looked up at her. She was looking down, shaking her head side to side at him in polite refusal.
"Baby I know you'll love it, it's better than just around the rim," Sam said, still working his other fingers in and out of her wetness.
"No, it's dirty," Viv said. "I don't want you to. dPlease don't ruin a nice thing."
"Okay, baby," Sam said, moving his tongue back to her clit. "You got it."
Viv smiled and laid back, her head hitting the pillow as her eyes rolled up into her head and she moaned loudly. Sam licked and fingered her to two more quick orgasms; her legs shook so violently on the second one Sam had to hold her down to keep her from kicking him in the face. When she finally calmed down, he kissed her along her thighs gently, and then planted one more sloppy kiss on her pussy lips. She gave a jolt, and he got up off the bed and padded over to the bathroom, large cock standing out straight from his body, wagging back and forth and he walked.
He washed his face - Viv didn't like kissing him with her juices all over his mouth and in his beard - dried it on a fluffy towel and then walked back to the bedroom, cock still at 12 o'clock. He stepped inside and saw that Viv had turned off the bedside light; in the dim light of the streetlamps, he could see she was under the covers.
He knew better than to ask for a reciprocal blowjob; it wasn't really Viv's thing, and she always complained that her jaw hurt afterwards. It had to be a truly special occasion for her to put him in her mouth, and usually he got about three minutes to either cum or move on to sex.
He was ready to skip that step and move to fucking his beautiful fiancée, so he moved to his side of the bed, slid under the covers and nuzzled his face into her neck, spooning her.
"Baby that was wonderful," she said dreamily, "Almost as good as our sixth date."
"Not as good?" he teased. "I was worried you were going to float away by the third orgasm."
"Nothing will be as good as the first time you did that to me," she said. "It was so special."
"I was scared shitless, your parents were right down the hall," Sam said.
"It was just amazing, I'll never forget how hard you made me cum," she said.
"I still can't believe they didn't hear you moaning," he said. "He snuggled her and kissed her along the side of her neck, then scooted down so the tip of his cock was at the entrance to her still soaked slit.
"Mmmm, don't take too long, okay baby?" she said distantly, "I have an early spin class before two big client meetings tomorrow."
"Okay sweetheart," Sam said, and he pushed himself into her. Viv moaned slightly but lay still.
"And don't finish on me, okay? I don't want to have to clean up."
"Sure thing," Sam said.
Sam pumped in and out of her from behind while she lay in bed. He reached around and groped her chest while he fucked her, and she ground her hips back into him. She occasionally let out a gasp or little moan, but didn't say anything else. True to his word, when he was ready he rolled over onto his back and finished all over his own chest. He got up, careful not to let his cum drip on Viv's carpet, and headed back to the bathroom.
He turned back to look at her in the semi-dark of the city light coming in around the blinds; she was asleep before he left the bedroom. He wiped himself off, then he cleaned up the kitchen and dining room, tossing out the meal that had been sitting out for hours. Then he showered and went to bed.
***
Tuesday
Sam was up reading his paper and drinking his first cup of coffee at the dining room table when Viv emerged from the bedroom and headed straight for the coffeemaker. She needed a minimum of 8.5 hours of sleep each night or else the following day was a disaster; Sam rarely needed more than 6, so he was often the first one up.
Viv yawned and poured herself a cup, adding almond milk and Splenda.
"Any surprises?" she asked Sam from the kitchen behind him.
"Nothing substantial," he said, scanning the paper.
"Anything worth my time coming?" she said, puttering around the kitchen.
"Maybe, Randi... " Sam started, and he could actually feel Viv stiffen behind him. He was the only person who still called her that, a nickname from a bygone era. The familiarity rankled Viv a little bit, but he couldn't have stopped if he wanted to. She was Randi to him. "You know that weird old house up on Ash Street, the Van Hooten place?"
"Broken down old Victorian?" Viv recalled.
"That's it; some rich European guy bought it and fixed it all up. Randi was headed there last night to a private glitterati party to get the scoop on who this guy is. Apparently he paid cash for it up front."
"She's probably angling for a husband ... or at least a fancy vacation," Viv said, pretending to mutter. Sam heard it loud and clear, just as he was supposed to.
"Right. So anyway, that could be interesting," Sam said with a sigh. "Been a long time since new a power player came to town. Eric's working on another murder/suicide, cops are calling it a 'crime of passion.' Violet Ellis killed the headmaster at Rockford County Day."
"The club owner?" Viv asked, and when Sam nodded, said "Do you think they were, you know ... "
"Fucking?" Sam prompted.
"Gross, Sam," Viv scolded. "Leave the locker talk in the newsroom."
She came around to the front of the table, breakfast-to-go and gym bag ready for her spin class excursion, and glanced at the full color photo on the front page. "That looks messy."
"Anything exciting in your world today?" Sam asked.
"I'm meeting with Father and some of his Preservation Society friends for lunch," she said. "They're still trying to save the factory buildings at the Riverwalk and convert them rather than letting the developers knock them down. I guess they think I might be able to mobilize some of my art clients to support the effort."
"Any chance at that?" Sam asked. "Do people who buy art care about historical preservation?"
"Some ... but really, not too many," she said. "However a loyal daughter does what her father asks."
"I'm surprised your father needs to call in the cavalry - usually he can rally support for stuff like this, right?"
Viv bent down and kissed Sam on his forehead.
"Times change," she said, and headed to the door.
"Have a great day, sweetheart!," he said to her back.
"I will!" he heard from the hall just before the door slammed shut.
***
The newsroom was still somewhat quiet when Sam got into the office around 7:30; most reporters didn't make it in before 10 a.m., so the mornings were the best time to get non-deadline work done. Sam dove into various pieces of paperwork; budget stuff was coming due for the annual report, and he had all sorts of odds and ends to pull together before that monster would be slain.
The tide turned and reporters started to flood into the newsroom, and the madness quickly ramped up to full pitch. Phones rang, keyboards clacked and banter was thrown about. Sam enjoyed his homemade ham sandwich at his desk - with mustard and sweet pepper relish - and kept on working through lunch. Tuesday's story meeting came and went; Lily was out but dutifully sent an email to update Sam on what she was working on for her story.
At 3:30 or so Sam was up at the copy machine scanning expense sheets - the newspaper hadn't exactly modernized much of its internal paperwork - when he caught a glimpse of Miranda furtively entering the office through the side door closest to her desk.
She was wearing big sunglasses and her blonde hair was up in the pen-bun, both of which were normal enough. But strangely she was wearing a cobalt blue silk blouse that clung to her buxom chest in a much more alluring manner than she'd normally display at work, unbuttoned just enough to give a guy a good look. She had on a tight pencil skirt that couldn't be easy to walk in, let alone sneak, and the real coup: she was wearing heels. In the office. Pumps that perfectly matched the blouse, no less.
Sam had never in 11 years seen her wearing heels outside of some fancy function; he knew she actually hated them and wore flats whenever she could get away with it. But they did exaggerate her figure quite well, breasts and ass just a little more prominent.
Despite her attention-grabbing attire, she was clearly looking to sneak into her desk. Sam finished up his scanning and drifted over towards her desk; when he got there, he looked over her cube and saw her bent over, listening to messages on her work phone and jotting down notes.
She saw Sam out of the corner of her eye and started, head whipping around, and then heaved a big sigh of relief when she saw it was him. She held up a single finger to tell him to wait, finished retrieving the messages from her phone, and then softly put the phone back in the receiver.
"Jesus, Randi, are you okay?" Sam asked softly, not wanting to blow her cover.
"Yes. Uh, no. Fuck, I don't know yet," she said, frantically gathering a few things from her desk and tossing them into her bag.
"What happened at the ..." Sam started.
"Not here! Can you meet me at the coffee shop on 3rd in 15 minutes?" Miranda whispered.
"Uh ... yes?"
"Okay! I'll talk to you then," she said, and then breezed out of the office as best she could on her four-inch heels.
When Sam made it down to the coffee shop, closer to 20 minutes later, Miranda was sitting at a corner table in the back, sunglasses still on, oscillating between sipping a huge cappuccino and looking at something on her phone. She looked up and saw Sam and gave him a wave; Sam got a coffee and joined her.
"Randi, what the fuck?" Sam said as he took his seat.
"Sorry about the weirdness in the office Sam, I'm ... not feeling so well ... and I didn't want to ... get bogged down with office stuff," Miranda said. "I'm taking a sick day and I just needed to check my messages. The damn call in voicemail thing is screwed up again."
Sam looked her over from across the table; she didn't look sick, she actually looked ... strangely vivacious, almost glowing.
"You look okay to me ... actually you look better than okay," Sam said, eyeing her up and down. "You might be the only person who dresses up on their sick days. What's with the outfit?"
She looked down at herself, almost seeing her clothing for the first time. She quickly did up another button on her blouse, and then looked at Sam.
"This, oh it's nothing," she said, lying badly. "It's just laundry day, that's all."
"Riiiighhht," Sam said skeptically. "And the pumps? All your sneakers at the dry cleaners too?"
"Fuck the pumps," Miranda said in a harsh whisper, jerking forward across the table. "Listen, Sam ... last night at the party, at Luc's ... I saw some things. I did some things, things I didn't want to do ... except ... "
"Oh shit, Randi, you didn't fall off the wagon, did you?" Sam said, suddenly very concerned. "Is that why you're wearing the sunglasses, because you're hungover?"
He reached out and took the big sunglasses off his long-time friend's face, and Miranda didn't lift a hand to stop him. He'd been there when they were both young reporters, covering for her while she puked half the morning away, snorted a line of coke off the bathroom sink, and then started drinking again by lunch. Her dad died when she was just out of school, left her the sizable family fortune, her own swanky downtown condo and emotionally empty inside.
She went way over the edge, trying to feel something again. When it finally all came crashing down, Sam had been the one to drive her to rehab and picked her up after she finished her program. He'd been scared for years that she'd fall off the wagon because of her job; she was constantly attending parties and galas, official dinners and other things where it was de rigueur to professionally tie one on. But in eight years since Sam picked her up she hadn't had a drink; it was the most amazing display of mental fortitude Sam had ever seen.
Now he looked at her with all the friendship and brotherly concern he could gather in his gaze, and two very bloodshot eyes looked back at him.
"Now do you see why I couldn't come into the office," she said. "People would jump to the same conclusion you did."
"So you're saying you're not hungover," Sam said levelly.
"Sam, I swear to you I'm not," Miranda said, holding his gaze levelly.
Sam looked at her for a few heartbeats, and then leaned back in his chair and took a big sip from his coffee. She was not a good liar, and she wasn't lying now.
"What, so did you get pink eye from that dusty old house?" Sam said.
"No I don't have pink eye," Miranda said, flustered. "At least, I don't think you can get pink eye that way."
"WHAT way?"
Miranda took a deep breath.
"I got cum in my eyes," she said, exhaling.
Sam sat there a beat, unsure he heard her correctly. He rewound his brain and replayed what she just said - an old reporter trick - and after confirmation, he did the only thing he could do. He burst out laughing.
Miranda rolled her very bloodshot eyes at him again and plucked her sunglasses out of his hand, returning them to her face.
"You meet a rich European guy in the clerk's office," Sam said, slowly catching his breath, "and later that night you let him cum on your face?"
"I wouldn't say that, no," Miranda said, frowning.
Sam suddenly sat bolt upright, blood draining from his face, all mirth forgotten.
"You didn't let him, did you?" Sam asked angrily, getting louder. "He forced you, didn't he. He raped you. I will ... "
Miranda reached out and grabbed Sam's arm to cut him off and hunched down at the table, trying to shield herself from a few turning heads.
"For fuck's sake, Sam, will you lower your voice and shut the fuck up for a second," Miranda whispered. "Nobody fucking raped me, I'd be at the police department if they had."
"Okay, okay, I'm listening," Sam said, voice lowered again.
Miranda took another deep breath, let it out, and said, "It was more than one guy. It was four or five. Actually definitely five. And Luc wasn't one of them."
Sam blinked and then teetered backwards, falling as if physically struck. The back of his chair caught him, and he rebounded up off of it and leaned forward across the table.
"That's, uh ... that's a new one," he said quietly.
"I can explain ... I think. Sort of," Miranda said, and thrust her phone into his hands. She titled it horizontally, called up a video and pressed play.
The video began out of focus and the lighting was pretty dim with a red tint, but the camera adjusted itself and Sam made out what was happening pretty quickly. The video was shot at a weirdly low angle, but it unmistakably showed two people fucking. Actually, it was a tall muscular black guy fucking a very well-endowed blonde's tits as she held them together, and she was taking the tip of his cock hungrily into her mouth at the end of every stroke, slurping it audibly. Sam looked around to see if anyone else could hear the moans coming from the video, but nobody seemed to notice. Sam turned back to the video and watched for a few more seconds; the man thrusting, occasionally lightly slapping the woman's large breasts as she held them for him to fuck.
"That ... that's quite something Randi," Sam said. Despite being in a bit of shock from the last minute of bizarre personal revelations and sex videos, Sam felt his cock twitch in his pants. The tit-fucking on the video on Miranda's phone was still very hot - if surprising - and he was still a man.
"Look at their faces; do you recognize who that is?" Miranda said.
Sam took a closer look - their faces hadn't been high priority until now - but after a few seconds he actually did know who both of them were.
"Holy shit, Randi," Sam said. "That's a video of the third district State Rep. Maxwell Gentry tit-fucking the Channel 12 weather girl Bianca whats-her-name."
"Yeah," Miranda said, taking her phone back. "Bukowski."
"And I'm pretty sure they're both married," Sam said.
"Yeah," Miranda said. "and not to each other."
"Holy shit," Sam said, leaning back in his chair again. He took a big sip from his coffee and stared into the distance thoughtfully, then looked back to her. "So ... how did that lead to five dudes cumming on your face?"
"Yeah, so ... you saw how the angle on that video was kind of low? Well that's because I was trying to surreptitiously shoot the video from underneath the table where I was sitting, and they're up on a raised circular platform covered in pillows. It was risky as hell, but that whole thing had been going on for a while and I was sure nobody was paying any attention to me."
"So you got caught?"
"After Max finished by cumming all over Bianca's tits - and I mean all over them, I didn't think one person could have so much cum - and she licked the cum off her own tits and swallowed it like she was starving for it ... uh, yeah, so right after they finished, Luc came up behind me and plucked me out of my seat, holding my wrist of the hand that had the phone in it. I guess I was kind of transfixed by the two of them and wasn't paying enough attention, because he really came out of nowhere to get the jump on me. I was trying to be careful."
"Anyway, he holds up my wrist above our heads so everyone can see the phone, and he wraps his other arm around my waist and pulls me close into his body, so my ass is rubbing right up on him."
"Nobody moves, nobody says a fucking thing, but they're all looking right at me, including Bianca and Max. Luc bends down and whispers into my ear, 'Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. And with this, you're entering free fall, Miranda.'
"So I turn to him and look at him, getting ready to cry out, to claw his eyes and run, to pull the mace from my bag and fill the room with it, whatever it took, and I look into his eyes. He has these deep, deep brown eyes, almost black but not. He pulls me tighter to him and we're pressed against each other, chest to chest. I can feel my heart beating fast and frantic, and I can feel his too, and it's calmly beating away, like he's doing nothing more strenuous than taking an afternoon nap. He's grip on me is so strong, but it's not threatening or aggressive, he's just holding me in place, phone up above my head, body pressed into his, solid.
And everything falls away from the two of us. It's like we're just standing in a dark void, he and I, we're the only things that exist. And I swear his mouth didn't move as I looked at his eyes, but as sure as I'm sitting right here in this chair talking to you, his voice fills my head and it says: 'you have the choice: stay or go.'"
Sam sat across from Miranda while the tale spilled out of her, watching her. All the while she had a faraway look in her eyes, looking across the middle distance while she recalled the prior evening, almost as if she were in a trance.
Now she was stuck, as if those words - 'stay or go' - were still echoing in her head. Sam waited for her to continue, but she just gazed out across the room, looking at nothing.
Finally, Sam prompted her.
"And ... "
Miranda shook herself, and looked back at Sam. Then she looked down at the table.
"And I stayed."
"You stayed," Sam repeated.
"I stayed," Miranda said, still looking at the table. "Because I wanted to stay. And I wanted to kiss Luc. So I kissed him."
"You kissed him?" Sam said incredulously.
"Yes, is there a fucking echo in here or something?" She said, snapping her head back up to Sam. "I kissed him. It bubbled up from deep inside me, and it was the thing I desired the most right in that moment. So I did it."
"And then what happened?" Sam said.
"He kissed me back, and it was good. And then we were back in the room, some dimly-lit swanky red-tinted room in his big Victorian mansion. And we're kissing in a room with Bianca the weather girl still licking up cum and a state rep standing over her, cock in hand, panting. And there are so many other famous people there, Sam, I can't even tell you: athletes and politicians, actresses - that chick from the insurance commercials - and people who run local charities, university presidents, everybody. And Luc reaches down and sweeps me off my feet, still looking directly in my eyes, and carries me to the platform that Bianca and Max were just on and sets me there.
And I'm kneeling on a sweat-soaked cushion, and Luc circles around me, one finger trailing along my shoulders, and he stops when he's directly behind me. He reaches round my body and effortlessly rips my shirt right off me, so I'm there in my lacy black bra, kneeling. And then ... and then I reach behind my back and undo my bra, and it falls away, and my tits are out in front of everyone."
"Wait ... you undid your own bra? He didn't take it off you?"
Sam couldn't believe what Miranda was telling him. She'd been serially single for years; she had hooked up her fair share in her wild early 20s, but she'd calmed down considerably since she came back from rehab. This ... this was not like the Randi he knew at all. Now she kept almost all romantic attachments at arms length, focusing on her job. She'd always been quite modest, actually, careful to keep her business out of the streets lest it compromise her position as the gossip and nightlife writer at the paper.
"Definitely not. I took my bra off. I ... I don't know why."
"Fuck," Sam said. "Randi, you don't need to ..."
"Yes I do," she cut in. "Let me finish. I have to tell somebody about this, somebody I trust."
Sam leaned back and took a sip from his coffee, now barely room temperature, and he gestured for her to continue. He also had to reach down and readjust his cock, which was painfully pinned down his pant leg.
"So my bra is off, and I cup my breasts, and I look back over my shoulder at Luc. And he's still looking right into me with those brown eyes, but I see he's holding my phone, recording me at the center of the room, fondling myself. And I don't care.
"And he says to me, 'Those who restrain desire do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained.' He quotes William fucking Blake at me, Sam. And I just nod, and slowly lick my lips. Then he nods. I look back out and scan the crowd, and there are men standing and walking towards the stage that I'm on, as if they knew what it was I desired without me even having to say it. Behind them I can see that other people have their phones out and they're recording me now, too. And I close my eyes, and I lightly pinch my own nipples, and I cum for the first time, right there on the platform, with everyone watching me, without anyone touching me by myself."
"Then there are five men surrounding me, their crotches even with my face, and then I've taken all their cocks out. And I just start sucking them, first one by one around the circle, making eye contact with each one while I do it like that man is only man in the room. Then I take one in my mouth while I jerk off two others. And the only noise in the whole place is just me moaning and slurping and sucking these cocks, and the men groaning and telling me how good a cocksucker I am and how beautiful I look."
"Randi, I don't ... ," Sam started.
"Yes you do," Miranda said over the top of him. "Shut the fuck up and let me finish."
Sam nodded, and tried to clear his throat. Miranda looked back to the middle distance, and after a few moments resumed her tale.
"I can tell the men are getting close to cumming, and suddenly Luc grabs me by my hair and tugs me down so my ass is on my heels and my head is tilted back and I'm looking directly at Luc and he's looking down at me, one hand snaked through my hair and the other recording me with my own phone. And I grab my tits and lick my lips again, and then the first man cums all over me, all over my face, spurt after spurt, painting me with his hot cum. And I cum so hard, unlike I've ever cum before, I can feel myself squirting and soaking my own panties. Each guy pops off on me, all over my tits and face, and I can feel their hot jism running down my face and body, and it feels like each time a stream of cum hits me I orgasm again until I'm screaming and so much cum is in my mouth and I'm shivering and shaking. It was pure ecstasy."
"Then all I can hear is what I think is the blood rushing in my ears, just pure white noise. But as I come back to my senses a little I realize it's actually cheering, thunderous, ear-splitting applause. I try to wipe the cum from my eyes and I realize how much it's stinging and I don't care, but I look out and I see that everyone is on their feet and cheering like I just sang at Carnegie Hall or something. And Luc bounds up next to me and pulls me up by my hair so I'm standing and he raises his voice up over the crowd and booms out, clear as day, 'Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you Miranda.'
Miranda looked up from the table, and Sam's eyes were fixed on her, searching her face.
"It was the happiest I've ever been, Sam."
Sam blinked at her, absolutely unable to make any sense of it all.
"Randi, I ... that's just ... are you ... are you sure this happened? That it wasn't just a vivid sex dream?"
Miranda just looked at Sam for a few heartbeats, and then she put her phone back in his hand, and slid it one frame to the left with her thumb, and pressed play. Sam looked down, and there on her own phone was his oldest friend, bent backwards and staring up at the camera, holding her own naked breasts, her hair and makeup mussed and smeared. Then the first jet of cum splashed on her face, and her mouth turned to a broad smile, and she let out a noise born of pure pleasure and shook, and then she was hit by jet after jet of cum, and she could barely catch her breath for the next orgasmic cry.
Sam shuddered in his chair as his balls boiled over and he shot his load all over his underwear. He closed his eyes and gripped the table, trying to get a hold of himself. When he looked up and across the table at his friend, she was shuddering too and breathing heavily. Their eyes met.
"I just came again, watching you watch the video," Miranda said.
"I came too," Sam said.
"I know," Miranda said, softly.
Together they sat silently for a bit, catching their breath. Finally Miranda reached out to take her phone back from Sam, and her hand rested on his for a moment.
"Let's go for a drive, get cleaned up and talk about what happens now," Miranda said.
"Okay," Sam said. "Let me call into the paper and let them know I had to leave early. Family emergency."
Miranda smiled.
