*****
Nuru got up bright and early the next morning. There was a bit of time before he met up with Dayo, so he went out to investigate the other things he'd heard.
"Why, hello Nuru!"
"Good morning, Hasina."
"I've got caterers working on the banquet for an out of town guest. There's simply no privacy to be had if you were thinking..."
"Oh, no, but I'm flattered you'd consider it."
"Then what brings you by today?" Hasina's face dimpled a bit as she smiled.
"Well, a little bird told me that you have a music box you want repaired."
"Your little bird is suspiciously well-informed. Does it have a name?"
"I call it 'friend-of-a-friend.' I don't know its true name."
"Well, be that as it may. I'll tell you, my husband has been promising me for months that he'll send it out to a craftsman and get it repaired. It was a gift from my sister when we were young, may she rest in peace. Made it to Level 38 before a dire manticore killed her whole party."
"I'm so sorry to hear that."
"Me too, but she died doing what she loved, and that's the most important thing. But you're not a craftsman, Nuru, why do you think you can fix it?"
"Well, I am a bard. I have Musical Knowledge, and an unusually high DEX score. I figure I can at least take a look."
"Alright. Just be careful, I don't want it too badly damaged if I have to get a specialist. It'll cost extra then."
"Yes, of course."
She led him into the study, and took the music box down from a shelf.
"There are some basic tools in the drawer next to you; my lout of a husband thought he'd take a crack at himself, but he hasn't anything like the right skills. I'm just thankful he didn't break anything. I'll leave you to it, let me know if you need anything."
"Thank you, Hasina. I will."
It proved to be quite a challenge. The music box had sat neglected for some time, begun to rust, and the pins holding it together had become brittle. The magical speed crystal was a good quality, and was in good shape, fortunately, as was the note plate. He managed to scrape away most of the rust to reveal a metallic shine, and cleared dust that had congealed around some sticky grease in the teeth and prevented the notes from coming out properly. Hours later, he got it all put back together and put the speed crystal into the slot.
Hasina came back from the other room at the sound of it.
"Oh my gosh! Nuru, you've done it!"
"Well, I'm afraid I have nothing to polish it with, and I don't think the pins will stand up to another disassembly, but yes, it's working."
"Oh, thank you so much! This means so much to me. How much do you want for that?"
"Oh, twenty currency would cover it."
"Hmm. That's more than I might pay for the craftsman. But transporting it to him would not be free and... come to think of it, this way I get to tell my husband - great mayor mind you, just a lousy husband - that I did it myself and put a dig to his conscience. Plus, I get to increase his estimation of my skills. It's a deal!"
"Thank you kindly."
"No, Nuru, thank you. You've made me a happy woman twice this week. You come on by anytime."
"Why, I think I shall. Good day!"
*****
The day had advanced more than he knew, and it was almost time to go exploring. He carefully threaded his way through the streets - much busier than he remembered on the day of the tournament - and tried to avoid getting too close to anyone that looked high level, in case they had Sense Demon. A few suspicious glances told him that he wasn't entirely successful, but he wasn't pursued, and thanked his LCK.
"I've come for that ring," he told the shopkeeper.
"Hm? Oh, yes. I almost threw it out anyway, I figured you weren't going to be coming. You didn't seem like you were really here to shop at all."
"Geez. Should have made a formal agreement, I guess, but I figured it was such a small item..."
"Never you mind, I figured a Blue Sun elf aught to act in accordance with higher principles, so I kept it even so. Here you are."
"Thank you. Here's your twenty."
"Come again soon!"
"Not likely," Nuru muttered on his way out. He sprinted out of the area as much as his stamina allowed, went out to the cabin at a more measured pace, and invoked his IOU.
"Nuru, what happened?" Dayo said.
"What do you mean?"
"Your MP. It's zero."
"Oh, that. Yeah I'm giving up MP for spring."
"Dammit, Nuru, this is serious. You're crippled, I can't babysit you out there, and the danger is real. We're out there picking through corpses much higher level than you, and the things that killed them might still be around."
"Oh, don't worry about that. Jaheem!"
The lyena bounded out of the trees towards them.
"Fuck. Nuru, get behind me!" Dayo yelled, materializing a wicked-looking metal-studded staff in a puff of smoke.
"No, no. He's with me."
"He... what? This is not your demon. Old Jaheem's just waiting for some foolish adventurer to let his guard down, and eat them, so I hear. Better safe than sorry."
"He owes me a favor."
"HE owes YOU a-"
"Yes. Believe it or not. Feeling better, my friend?"
Greeowf.
[Much.]
"Excellent. Dayo here is a friend also. Watch out for both of us, will you?"
Berk.
[Yes.]
"But especially me. I'm young and feeble, and a liability to everyone."
The old lyena howled with an unsettling laugh that made Dayo shiver.
"All right, all right. I take it back," Dayo grumbled. "You know what you're about to be doing is basically impossible at your level, right?"
"So I've heard."
"Do you actually understand him? How's that even possible for a Level Two? You're nowhere near the level required to handle the EXP cost for Greater Beast Language. Birds are simple enough, but lyenas..."
"A power I'm borrowing. From a demon."
"...I see."
/We need to talk about that, by the way/
"Yes, yes. Not now," Nuru said to his shoulder, the habitual way he addressed the succubus he had a pact with. He only knew her as Adana.
"Something the matter?" Dayo said.
"Not at all. Just one more thing I need to attend to."
"Right. So, one of my favorite places is this Goblin Warren where the queen's lieutenant sits. I'm not supposed to spoil the location of the queen, but I figure the lieutenant is the first one you run into, so that should be OK. Sometimes a high level adventurer tackles it solo trying to farm for amethysts, because it's actually an old amethyst mine the dwarves dug several Expansions ago. The queen likes her 'pretties,' so she sends the lieutenant to oversee a small mining operation there and, well, sometimes a solo adventurer gets cocky or forgets his HP potions. Bit tragic, but that's what happens when you get careless - or greedy. Sometimes the lieutenant doesn't even mind me there and they don't attack, and rather like me cleaning the bodies out, but other times, not so much. I know how to handle myself. I'll try to watch out for you, but no promises, you understand. Form a party?"
Dayo offered him a temporary pact, a travel and mutual assistance agreement, good for twelve hours or until either of them died. Profit sharing, EXP sharing, provision for notifying next of kin in the case of death. Standard as can be. Both of them signed, and off they went.
"So I'm dying to know, if you pardon the expression," Nuru said, laughing at himself as they jogged, "how is it that you level up as a necromancer?"
"Same as anybody else. Questing and killing."
"You can't take EXP of the fallen?"
"No. I'm a subclass you call a valkyrie. I can gather the spirit of a dead person, and I can bring their soul back to the altar of my goddess for its release, but the power I gain does not go into EXP or MP. It's a separate mechanic. I'm forbidden to go into too much detail with outsiders, I'm afraid."
"Oh. Well, alright," Nuru said, disappointed.
"But I can give you a basic overview, since it's a common thread among most of the Factions. As I'm sure you know, the High Archon of each Faction is empowered by one or more of the gods to bestow a certain gift, as are, to a lesser degree, the other archons. This gift works as a spell, and may use both MP and a unique mechanic to perform their rituals or Faction skills. Well, among the Low Factions, that mechanic is some form of soul power, gathered from dark ritual or dead bodies. Or from the 'pre-deceased' in the case of Cursed Ones, their way of saying a living being."
"Like vampires?"
"Among others, yes."
"So... what is our quest today?"
"Heh. I guess I can't very well quest with you and not share the objective. I'm gathering spirit power."
Dayo held up what looked like the shell of a lantern, with runes cut out of the metal shutters.
"How much of it?"
"As much as we can. I have a... quota you could say, but that's really just a daily goal I've set for myself in order to complete my quest within a few weeks."
"Think we could finish it today?"
"I doubt it. I've probably got a full week ahead before I have enough, conservatively."
"And liberally?"
"Well, assuming we do something totally crazy and reckless, I might finish it today. But I'm not willing to risk that until I know how we work together - if we do. You are a man, after all."
"I'll try not to let that get in the way," Nuru said drily.
"You jest, but I've had some bad experiences with co-ed parties. You're lucky I'm considering it at all."
"I appreciate that," Nuru said. "Shall we? Daylight's burning."
"Oof, you're telling me."
Dayo said, pulled the silver hat down to cover their face.
"Don't tell me you're a vampire," Nuru said.
"No, just - minor side effect of my Faction Alignment. Low Faction mostly don't spend much time in the sun, even if they're not of the Cursed variety."
"Mesi's got a good tan going."
"Mesi rocks that smokey look, absolutely. But she's unaligned; we met before she picked a Faction, and then she decided she didn't want to adventure anymore. Took an arrow to the knee, or so she says. She class-shifted into dancer and spends all her free time dancing in the woods. For whose glory... you'd have to ask her yourself."
"An arrow to the knee? And she dances? There's got to be more to that story."
"Hmm. I'm curious now, I'll have to ask her about that."
"I noticed she's got no tan lines. I do know what that means."
"The nudity taboo never did sit well with her. I think that opened her sheltered mind and why she didn't run screaming when she found out my profession. She thinks there's a bit of a conflict of interest between my roles as a fighter who kills during quests, and a valkyrie who gathers spirits of the dead. But so far we've made it work."
"So you get EXP *and* you get your... special mechanic when you kill."
"That's right. I don't go in for those big adventure quests these days though; partly because Mesi doesn't like it, and partly because it's just... it wears on your soul. You go rampaging all over the place, and you get to be a bit jaded to it. I don't want someone taking *my* life like it's nothing."
"Totally with you there."
"We're here. Ready?"
"Sure. Jaheem, have a look around will you? Don't attack, just find out what's around."
Growf!
[On it!]
"Run the direction away from us if they start following! Unless you... need... help..." Dayo trailed off as the lyena disappeared.
"He'll be fine. He's got some tricks."
"Not worried about him, to be honest."
"Ah, right. Not really your friend. OK, so..."
A sudden scream broke the passive conversation and drew their attention towards a cave entrance. A goblin chased after the lyena waving a short sword and a spiked shield. It swung wide once, twice, thrice, and then sat down hard as a heavy blow struck below the shoulder of the sword arm. It sat, stunned, then picked itself up and took more measured strikes which also fell short. Jaheem continued harrassing the gobling for a short time, then turned and ran away. The goblin screamed and warbled in its own language, looking around carefully, saw them standing, and stopped, staring. When they made no move, he turned and walked back inside.
"Occupied, obviously," Nuru said.
"Right. That'll make this tougher, but maybe more productive."
"How so?"
"Well, if some adventurers came through, they wouldn't leave survivors. They've have to kill all the goblins, who won't leave their stronghold undefended. If the goblins aren't dead, maybe they didn't make it, and certainly didn't drag their dead with them."
"Oh, of course. So there might be a few bodies there, but it'll be difficult to get to."
"Let's see if anyone else comes through."
Jaheem trotted silently up enough that they both almost missed him.
"Oh hey, so that answers that. Do you know how many there are?"
Grrrowf. Snort.
[Many. Blood.]
Jaheem's ears pricked up, and he stared in the direction of the cave entrance.
Whine.
[Many coming.]
"Uh oh. Maybe we better go," Nuru said.
"Why? What's-" Dayo got out, before a group of armored goblins burst out and ran their direction. "There's too many! Run away!"
Jaheem War Charged right down the middle, bowling a few over and taking the attention of all the rest.
"Wait. Let's see what happens," Nuru said. "I won't leave him here alone."
After a moment, half of them clustered together under direction of the biggest; the others turned back to face Nuru and Dayo, breaking into a dash.
"They're fast. We wouldn't have gotten far," Dayo said, grimacing. "Well, you wouldn't have. Better to face them here while you have your breath."
Dayo stepped forward, taking an aggressive stance. Two of them charged after Nuru, breaking to go around, but Dayo turned her staff horizontal at the last moment and caught both of them. They were strong and pulled the valkyrie along with them, but they slowed down as Dayo's boots dragged in the dirt. They turned towards this more immediate foe, and one of them promptly got hit in the face with an arcane blast, staggering him. The other took a swing and only managed to catch the staff planted in the dirt, bouncing back and throwing it off balance. The third globlin hurled some small object that trailed an ugly smoke. The second goblin covered its eyes and ducked, but Dayo didn't see it and was hurled to the ground as the object exploded violently. The second goblin ran over towards her to finish the valkyrie off, but found that the staff had grown a scythe blade that whistled menacingly as it cleft the air in its direction. It dodged to the side, but its momentum halted. The third goblin took aim with a small crossbow at Nuru, and found itself set upon by lyena from behind that bellowed and growled and chomped at it menacingly with jaws bigger than its head.
[Can I kill them now?]
The three goblins that had been chasing Jaheem mustered and came at him again, and he dodged away.
"Soften them up, we'll finish them!" Dayo called out.
Jaheem knocked one into another, then chomped onto the wrist of a third, wreaking horrible injury on the muscle under its armor. It screamed in pain, but passed its blade to the other hand.
Nuru stood, watching and waiting, unsure what to do, but unwilling to leap in against the stronger foes.
Dayo threw down some kind of rune, and waited. The goblin blasted earlier shook its head and came straight in, only to lose its footing in the arcane circle and fall into a puddle of magic-induced mud. As it climbed back up in quickly-solidifying ground, it took a blow from the staff Dayo swung like a bat, dealing a critical hit and killing it. The second turned back to Nuru and charged, but then stopped when it found he was no longer there, having run some feet away. It turned and charged him again, waving its weapon dramatically, only to meet empty air again. It looked around and saw him, took an arcane blast on its shield which absorbed the blow, then came on again.
Nuru was quickly running out of stamina. He reached for the only thing he had with him - low-level scrolls.
Dayo went after a few distracted goblins with a one-two punch; first the staff knocked aside the shield, then an arcane blast swept them off their feet. Finally, the staff battered their helm in and laid them down permanently.
The goblin running after Nuru was undeterred by his sudden aloneness and kept on. He got a snowball to the face, and stopped in mid step. He shook the snow away, looked one way, and the other. It felt a blow from behind and turned around, finding Nuru shaking the remains of Fire Hand away. It jolted into action, but stopped again and sniffed. Something wasn't right. And then it noticed the flames leaping up from its own back where Fire Hand had been planted right between the metal shoulder guards on its unprotected spine.
The goblin shrieked, started running back towards the cave, and then stumbled as the pain swept past the adrenaline. It got up, dropping its shield and weapon, and ran again only to panic, stopping to tear off its armor and helmet. This, however, did not stop the flames which engulfed it. It fell and rolled, but in vain; the flames had stuck to its flesh and roared back up the moment the burning skin met the air. After a few moments more, it collapsed in a crackling heap.
Dayo laid down the last of the other goblins in time to see the burning goblin thrashing and smoking.
Jaheem trotted up casually, as if just out for a morning stroll.
"Nuru, do me a favor," Dayo said slowly, eying the roasted fiend as it expired.
"What's that?"
"Forget I ever said anything about kicking your ass."
Nuru grinned. "I just assumed it was rhetorical."
"I appreciate you saying so."
"What level are you, anyway?"
" 'Never ask a girl her level'," Dayo quoted.
"I'm lucky you're not a girl, then, aren't I?"
Dayo burst out laughing.
"Well played! I'm Level Twenty."
"And these goblins, they're..."
"You can't read them? Oh, I guess not if your Lore and Basic Knowledge aren't high enough. They're Level Eight, maybe a few Level Nines."
"I'm really in over my head, aren't I?"
"Didn't I say so? You're lucky Jaheem's Level Thirty-Five."
"Holy crap. How did you get bested by a Rising Sun champion?"
Grunts and funny sounds.
[A beast does not have the luxury of enchanted equipment, nor did I get the buffs of a hundred allies cheering me on.]
"All this time, Gram's been full of shit," Dayo mused. "That butcher's been the one that's been telling everyone that Jaheem would eat their children, but at the same time refusing to post a bounty. You wouldn't do it, would you?"
The big feliform shook his head, making a retching face.
[You ever tried to eat human?]
Dayo cackled. "I don't need translation to know what that means!"
"So, now what?" Nuru said.
"Now I harvest these spirits. Check your EXP, and loot the bodies for anything useful. I'll let you have first dibs."
Nuru looked inward.
"Woah! I'm maxed out!"
"Wow. As high a level as Jaheem is, I'm surprised... oh, but he can't officially party with us, can he?"
"He said he could not give me any EXP with his kills."
"That would be a no, then. Plus you did the final blow on one of these idiots, so you got extra for that. I forgot how quick your EXP fills up at that level."
"I better go spend it, then. How long will it take you to do your special mechanic?"
"I've got to have those conversations, even with goblins. And I'll scout around for any adventurer bodies that are about. I'll be good for awhile if you want to run back to town and grab your level."
"I'll do that."
He checked pockets on all the bodies, crinkling his nose at the smell. "Don't these things bathe?"
"They use oil; cook with it, clean with it, bathe with it. Still haven't found a formula that isn't highly flammable."
"Ohhhhh. So why didn't we hit them all that way?"
"Fire's a bit unpredictable. Bit expensive, too, MP-wise. I do a lot of work in the forest, so I don't slot any unless I've got a special purpose."
"Uh, right. Bad idea I guess. I'll have to be careful."
"Nothing bigger than Fire Hand, that's for sure. I didn't know the scroll had a critical immolation effect. Don't use scrolls much, myself."
"I'll be back in a bit. Jaheem, come with me."
"Right. We've got time for one more location today if there's no delays."
"Fantastic."
He went back to the temple, leaving Jaheem at the forest edge.
*****
"Here you go, Father," Nuru said, laying a few coins in the offering tray.
"My, your fortunes have changed, have they Nuru?"
"It's starting to come together," Nuru agreed.
"What's that I smell on you?"
"Goblin."
"Well done."
"They are now. Self-defense, though, you understand."
"As long as it's not brimstone, I guess," the priest said with a tight smile at the morbid pun.
Adana snickered in the back of Nuru's head.
/If only he knew./
Nuru resisted the impulse to reply over his shoulder.
"Right. Time to see what blessings I'm ready for."
He stepped up to the altar, and again his vision went white. He took a few Level Two skills and noted his significant stat bonuses. He pushed all of his elective permabuffs into CON to boost his stamina and HP.
"See you soon, Father."
"Tread carefully, my child. Live to fight another day."
"I'm on that, too."
*****
Nuru went back to the cave entrance, wandering just a little to fill in paths on his map. Though the spoils he carried were a small fortune for a Level Three, he wasn't worried about bandits with Jaheem watching out for him. He arrived just in time for Dayo to plunge the scythe into the last of the dead goblins and melt its flesh into a wispy nothingness.
"Any luck?" he asked.
"!Mutuwa Har Abada!"
The lantern now hanging from the middle of the scythe handle lit up purple, and then went dark.
"Flashy. Is that necessary?" Nuru said.
"Calling the spell name? Not really, but it's more fun that way. Also, I do it as a precaution; if there's any paladins watching, hopefully they won't think I'm casting a reanimation. Helps cut down on... misunderstandings."
"Does it happen often?"
"Often enough. Nuru, I've saved a bunch of time today, and you're Level Three now. How do you feel about doing something crazy?"
"Like what?"
"Like take on a re-ogre."
"A what ogre?
"Re-ogre. Ogre again. Reanimated."
"I'd be willing to watch, at least. I have to ask though, what's it called if it's a woman *and* reanimated? A she-re-ogre? Re-she-ogre?"
"Gender gets a bit muddy after death. That's part of why I'm... undecided, shall we say. 'Gaze long enough into the abyss, and the abyss gazes back into you.' I've had a lot of time to think about what it means to be alive. But, it's a re-ogre, not a she-ogre or a he-ogre or some prefix puzzle."
"You are still alive though, right?"
"Why wouldn't I be? Oh, because I'm not in either category. Yeah, I'm human, not re-human. Or re-valkyrie, if you like."
"Is that a thing?"
"They're usually called reavers, but that's technically accurate too."
"I see. And revenants?"
"Re-fighter just doesn't roll of the tongue as well, does it?"
"No, it doesn't. Thief?"
"Re-thief. Paladins tend to just call them 'recidivists'," she smirked.
"Soulsmith?"
"Lich."
"Oooh. This explains so much."
"Alright, I know where a re-ogre might be found. Do you mind if we're done with the questions for today? I'm a bit tired from all this talking."
"As long as it's on the table for tomorrow."
"We'll see," Dayo said.
"I suppose none of this is news to you," Nuru said towards his shoulder.
/Nope!/
Dayo looked up, then noticed he wasn't looking at her, then relaxed, but only a little.
"Anything I should know about a re-ogre?"
/Big. Strong. Not as smart or as clean as a live ogre. Possibly imbued with special permabuff, if they've had crystals surgically inserted. What am I, your librarian now?/
"Come on, you're getting a free show here. You could give me something for it."
/Pact's a pact. No renegotiating now, you said so yourself. Show's free. Advice isn't./
"What if I promise to get my MP back? A gentleman's agreement, shall we say?"
/We'll talk. If you live./
"Faithless bitch."
The succubus laughed suggestively, warming Nuru's face. /A faithless demon. You're funny./
Dayo turned and cast Silence. Nuru's vocal cords slacked, and refused to make noise when he tried to protest. She made an exaggerated sigh of relief. He stomped after her, working his jaw and waving his hands uselessly. She didn't release the spell until they reached the site.
*****
Dayo snapped her fingers. Nuru cleared his throat noisily, then stood attentively.
"We cool?" Dayo said.
"Yeah. No hard feelings, just being dramatic. Bard, you know."
"Good. So. Re-ogre. Don't get squished, we just need to get it down to 2% HP and I'll handle the rest."
"You ever do that Silence thing with Mesi?"
Dayo winked. "I ain't sayin' nothin'. Neither should you."
"I couldn't possibly."
Dayo snorted a laugh.
/Not if she Silenced you again/
"Thanks for getting the joke," Nuru said over his shoulder. "And murdering it."
/I'm young, I need the EXP/
Nuru palmed his face. "Right. Weaknesses?"
"Nothing you'd have," Dayo said.
"Don't be so sure," Nuru said.
"Well, what kind of demon are you working with?"
"Succubus."
"Well, I'll be twice-damned. She have Entrancement?"
Nuru tapped his shoulder twice.
/Sigh. Yes./
"You don't seem too busy over there. Doesn't seem unreasonable for me to borrow that."
/Fiiiiine./
Nuru nodded to Dayo, who tipped her hat and turned and led him to an oversize log cabin so big it probably qualified as a megamansion.
"Sense Enchantment for me, will you?" Nuru muttered to his shoulder.
/Fire suppression in the walls. Can't burn the place down. I don't sense anything else. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm have to go see a man about a penis./
Nuru grimaced. They walked out boldly, hearing no disturbance in the forest.
"What's all this?" Nuru asked, looking at the squares of dead vine nets laid out on the ground, between brown patches of grass.
"Best stay clear," Dayo said.
Nuru knelt and looked close, half as much to take his mind off the succubus's words as curiosity. There were some wooden spikes just poking out of the dirt where the open spaces were. He reached in and carefully brushed the dirt away. The spike widened the further down he went, and the dirt fell down into emptiness.
"Some kind of trap," Nuru said. "But who would fall for it?"
"An ogre," Dayo said, poking at the dirt with her staff. "They wouldn't see this, especially at night. Re-ogre probably built it to protect the house from anything big enough to challenge it. Doesn't consider smaller things a threat, maybe."
They continued forward carefully, but without incident. They stepped past giant tripwires and log drops. A pile of sharpened logs lay ominously next to the massive doorway.
"Can we just knock?" Nuru said.
"I doubt if you could hear a thing with your ear pressed to the back. But that crack looks big enough."
The door was not made with precision, and the door had torn up the dirt on the latch side deep enough to squeeze under. Nuru and Dayo did so, but Jaheem took a giant leap up onto the opposite side of the doorway and hopped through the opening above the hinge and dropped effortlessly down to the dirt floor.
"Show off," Nuru muttered.
Jaheem barked a laugh.
"Ssh," Dayo said.
"Can you scout quietly?" Nuru asked.
Jaheem gave a noncommittal grunt.
"Well, stick with us then, and keep your ears open."
Uuurgh grunt.
[Something big ahead, two hundred feet, as the eye sees]
They walked quietly forward from room to room, unable to see what was on the tables and shelves crammed wall to wall.
Retch.
[One hundred feet]
"Wait, have we...?" Nuru said.
"What?" Dayo said.
Then the re-ogre came around the corner. It stopped and just stared. The three stared back. It scratched its head.
"Naaaaaaaaaame," it said.
"My name is Nuru."
It shook its head, tapped its chest.
"Naaaaaaaame."
"Dayo, what is its name?"
"Crap, I don't know. I'm Dayo, what is your name?" She asked, curtsying.
"Noooo naaaaaaaame, INTRUDERRRRRR!" it bellowed.
"Jaheem!" Nuru called, but the lyena was already in motion.
"Shit!" Dayo screamed, scrambling under a table.
The lumbering giant stepped forward and hunched to reach after her, ignoring the suddent weight of the lyena on its back. Jaheem had bitten a giant mole and was tearing at it and digging in with all four paws. Nuru threw a snowball, hitting it in the face, then turned and went back the way they had come in, running for his life. He heard the sounds of tables being thrown about, deafening cries of increasing rage following him. He scrambled under the door and wondered if he was being a coward.
"Move!" Dayo yelled under the door at him.
He pulled himself up and stepped out of the way; Dayo got out scant moments before the door itself was thrown open, kicking up a shower of dirt. Nuru spat some of it out, then turned to look. There was room here, but not a lot.
"Jaheem! Get its attention!" He called.
The feliform dropped free of the re-ogre's back and leaped to clamp down on the flesh under the loincloth and swung by his jaw. The re-ogre's eyes widened a bit and it looked down, then reached for the lyena. He dropped free just in time and scampered away. Dayo gave it an arcane blast to the inside of the knee; it stumbled a little, but did not fall. It pulled an arm back to give a mighty backhand at the valkyrie, but Jaheem ran up its unprotected side and swiped at its face.
It howled loud enough to wake the dead, then turned its focus to the lyena. It swiped, it slammed its fists, its palms, its feet. It walked over to the log pile and grabbed one of them, lifted it like a spear or a staff.
"Nuru! Entrancement! NOW!" Dayo called out. "Or we're all dead!"
Nuru pulled at his demon's power through the pact. Nothing happened until he hit the re-ogre with another snowball, and it turned its eye just enough to catch his gaze- and then the world distorted. He felt the air between them grow close, and felt as if he had grown and the ogre had shrunk until they were the same size. It felt almost intimate, as if the whole world were shrinking away and there was just the two of them, man and ogre, locked in a contest of wills. Nuru stepped carefully backward, unsure of his footing. The re-ogre followed, attempting to take the initiative.
"Jaheem! Stand down!" Nuru called out as the feliform braced for another leaping attack.
Nuru felt that he could not hold its attention this way if it were hit in the face again. He visualized the edge of the field, holding firmly in his mind where the edge of the spike trap was. He gestured with a finger, urging the re-ogre closer, to follow. He pulled some magic allure from Adana, heard her curse in his head.
/I'm not made of mana wafers over here, asshole!/
He stepped backwards, feeling the border vine right where he remembered it. He stepped back and sideways, finding his footing on a cross-vine, slowly eased back, feet sinking between the stakes. He gestured again, and the re-ogre followed. Back he went, back, back, and then the re-ogre wouldn't come any closer.
"Wanna dance?" he said, gesturing with his arms.
The re-ogre reached to take him in a dance position, but refused to step out onto the net of vines. It whimpered loudly, not quite able to reach him.
"Come on buddy, you can do it. See? I'm doing it."
"Traaaaap," it said, in an agitated voice.
"No, no. Safe space. Look at me."
The ogre watched him carefully take another step; if the creature saw what he saw, it looked like he was just delicately stepping right on the stakes themselves, taking no hurt at all. It looked down, then back up at Nuru.
"Traaaaap!" it cried.
Dayo was gesturing at Jaheem, which Nuru could barely see. They hit the re-ogre with Heavy Arcane Blast on one leg and a lyena charge on the other, staggering it but not quite knocking it over. Its attention wavered, and the Entrancement spell slipped a bit.
"No, no no, look at me. Look at meeeee," Nuru said soothingly.
It didn't work; the ogre reached over for one of the logs in the pile. It pulled it up and swung wildly, whooshing over Nuru's head.
"Traap! Traaaap!" it chanted in time with the swings.
"Traaaap kill!"
It slammed the log down towards Nuru, shifting the lay of the vines and making grab one of the stakes just below the point to hold himself up so he wouldn't fall and impale on it. He used his free hand to gesture at the re-ogre, but the illusion of equal size was slipping away; it took aim again and swung down, striking the stakes just in front of Nuru. Frustrated, it batted at him horizontally again once, twice. On the second swing, Dayo and Jaheem hit the backs of both knees, and finally the ogre fell forward under the weight of its own momentum. Its knees crashed down into the stakes and it screamed in pain. It reached up for Jaheem, who was climbed up on its shoulders and swiping at its ears. Dayo braced the staff between the ogre's back and the ground, letting its weight sag onto it as it struggled to keep its balance. Nuru carefully pulled himself one hand at a time towards the edge of the trap as the vines shook violently under him with the shifting weight of the re-ogre. Then Dayo pulled the staff free, letting the ogre fall backwards, and gave it one last Greater Arcane Blast as it shifted forward, overcompensating for the feeling of falling, and ultimately overbalancing it in the forward direction. Nuru could just reach over and touch it as close as it had fallen to him, and used one of his Fire Hands on the giant's arm. His handprint darkened and briefly burst into flame, but the re-ogre just bent its elbow to scratch at the spot with one of the stakes, and it fizzled out. He went back to climbing towards the edge and finally pulled himself free.
"Now what?" Nuru said, running over to stand next to Dayo.
"I'm running on mana fumes here. Jaheem, I think it's up to you. Sun's going down, we need to finish this. Ghouls will be out soon, and vamps won't be far behind."
Indeed, the sun had been below the trees since they'd emerged, and now was turning the distant horizon a dark orange.
Jaheem ran up the backs of the re-ogre's legs, and went for the face once more. This time, the ogre could not defend itself as its hands were impaled on stakes, and the lyena mauled it viciously. It could, however, twist itself hard, trying to shake Jaheem off, and managed to do so. The lyena slipped off into the trap itself and yelped as it took some injury.
[Nuru! The IOU! Send me back! I'm trapped!]
Nuru released Jaheem, who disappeared.
"This is your moment, Dayo. Make it good," Nuru said.
"Are you crazy?" Dayo said. "We've failed. We've gotta get out of here."
Nuru pulled on Adana, casting Liquid Courage on Dayo.
"What- what are you-"
Nuru clapped the valkyrie on the shoulder. "You can do this. I believe in you!"
Dayo took a deep breath, looked with narrowed eyes at the stricken re-ogre shedding HP with every twitch.
"2%. It's gotta be 2%," Dayo said. "Fuck, I can't do math all of a sudden. Max of 25,000, what does that come to?"
"Five hundred. Two percent is five hundred on this guy."
"Alright. Six fifty... Six twenty-five..."
Dayo stabbed at the back of one of its knees.
"Five seventy-five... Five fifty-five..."
Dayo tried to time by pumping a fist up and down, almost lost the rhythm, and then it was time. The valkyrie leaped straight out, coming in to land on the re-ogre's back, but slipped and got a foot caught in the waistband of its loincloth. It shivered as Dayo thrashed, trying to get free, then gave up on that and summoned the scythe blade on the staff. It arced down and buried itself in the ogre's spine, planting firmly and giving a lever to pull upright with. Dayo waved and materialized the lantern onto the handle as well, just as the re-ogre's life ticked down towards zero.
"!Babba Rai Magudana!" the valkyrie yelled at the top of her lungs. "...You bastard!"
The re-ogre slowly deflated in a gout of steam. The lantern filled with a lavender glow as the thin film that was all that was left of the great beast settled into place on the nets; Dayo flopped sideways and one of the stakes drew a gash, used Shadow Walk, and landed several feet away, near the tree line.
"Ugh... what was I thinking?" Dayo moaned. "I do not have the DEX for that kind of maneuver. Fat lot of good it would have done me to get stuck out there."
"Hey, you did it! That's all that matters," Nuru gushed, rushing over.
Dayo waved him away, downed an HP potion.
"I'm good. Oof, that was some battle. Fuck! Mesi's gonna flip when she hears about this."
Dayo finished dusting off, and then gestured for him to follow, taking off at a run back towards town.
"You're gonna tell her? Even if she doesn't like it?"
"Nuru, believe it or not, Mesi and I aren't the most obvious couple. We've had some trials. Let me tell you, the thing that's kept us together this whole time is good communication. I'm not giving that up now."
"Well, that's up to you, then."
"I have to ask you though. Are you really that lucky, or did you actually remember exactly where the edge of the pit and all the spikes were without looking?"
"Eidetic Memory."
"Fuuuuck me. So when you saw Mesi and I yesterday...."
"Every. Glorious. Detail. Anytime, anywhere."
"Gods below. If I'd known that was going to be a memory forever, I'd have put makeup on."
"You would?"
"Nuru, I don't call myself a girl anymore because I don't want to put makeup on every single day just to be taken seriously, but I still like to look good for special occasions."
"I might let you have another opportunity," Nuru said.
Dayo looked back at him; he winked. They laughed as they ran through the brush, pushing their way through rather than looking for a way around.

/Hey there, big boy, you feeling charitable? Because I've got a burning need/
"What's that?" Nuru said over his shoulder.
He was walking alone towards the temple now, ready to buy his fourth level.
/No, you're not? Oh, that's a shame. What if I get down on my knees and... beg?/
"Good heavens, what are you talking about?" Nuru muttered, standing up a little straighter.
/Well, that's too bad. I'm all worked up and nobody to satisfy me. I've heard about you, you big hunk. I think you've got exactly what I need./
"Hey, you didn't want me before, why did you change your mind?"
/Shut up, Nuru, I'm not talking to you. This is what I do, and I have quests to get done./
"Well can you do it quieter? I can't turn you off in my head."
/Nope. I'm an exhibitionist. I want you to hear every moment... Oh yeah? You like something you see? Why you're a very bad, very horny demon aren't you? It just so happens, I can help you with that. Dance for you? I should warn you, I get all hot and steamy and carried away. Alright, if you insist, you just sit down and get comfortable. There you go./
Nuru kept walking. It was getting harder to keep going in a straight line.
/I can feel you getting hard over there, Nuru. Hear something you like?/
"You're such a tease."
/Oh, just wait until you hear what I've got in store for this stud. Yeah, I'm talking to you. I'm getting all wet just looking at those merciless red eyes, that strong jaw, those beautiful fangs. I should have come and seen you days ago, I know, I've just been so... busy. No rest for the wicked. But of course you know what that's like. You've been working so hard, no time for pleasure. We both need this.../
Nuru rubbed his face, trying to keep his eyes pointed the right direction.
/Mm, yes, I do too. Do you see this? These tits are made for touching. They've been so lonely, aching for a gentle hand. Or maybe.... not so gentle./
Now he shook his head, trying to will away the distraction.
/...You're not sure? Take a closer look. Let me get this dress out of the way. There we go. Oh yeah, touch me. I'm melting for you. And you're getting so hard for me. Why sure, I can see it, bulging up in your loincloth. Oh, wow. What is that, twelve inches, at least? Fourteen! Oh, careful with that, you might poke somebody's ovary out. Not if you stick it in my face? Why, how would you know where I keep my ovaries? Well, prove it, mister. See if you can find my ovaries with that massive stalactite. Oh wait, it's sticking up now, it's a stalagmite. Hahahah!"
Nuru held his head in his hands. "What have I gotten myself into?"
/Oh, yes, grab me by the horns. Yeah, show me your will, you devil. Mmm, yes, you wanna fuck my face? Make me drool all over your 'wand of power.' Make me your dirty little demon whore./
Nuru was perfectly erect now, trying nonchalantly to hide it walking down the road into town. He considered running, then considered what would happen if Adana said something truly mind-boggling near some tree roots. He had good DEX, but he was tired and had a sense that he was under the influence of some other magical influence.
/Yes, slap me. Yeah, choke me. Show me what I'm good for./
Nuru tried not to imagine the half of the conversation he was missing, and failed.
/...What? Well, I can do a lot of things, but I'm not sure I'm equipped to gag on it. But if you think you can make me... Mmm. Mmmmmmm!/
The sounds of aggressive sexual contact echoed through Nuru's head. He was both a little terrified, and horrifically turned on. Was she just showing off, or did she really like that? Why had he ever thought he might be able to handle such a creature? The things she was willing to do - might even insist on doing...
/Oh, you are so ready! Take me! Take my every hole! Give me that hot magma!/
The temple was almost in sight now.
/Oh, yes! Slam that hard meat into my cunt! Destroy me with that mighty weapon!/
Nuru broke into a jog as he saw it, not so much believing that it would help, but just to be doing something trying to take his mind off of it. He went inside, ran to the altar.
"Back so soon?" Father Emeka said.
"Yes, Father, I've leveled again. Or, I'm ready to."
"You said you would be, but I hardly believed twice in one day... is something the matter?"
"Oh, nothing much, really." Just a voice in my head driving me crazy, he tried not to add.
"Wait, Nuru, wait. Slow down."
"What is it?"
"I sense something... Ah, best go get your level. But, promise me one thing."
"What's that?"
"Don't leave the safety of sanctuary here until I come back. OK?"
"What...?" Nuru said as the priest dashed away.
"Just do that, Nuru, stay here!"
He'd never seen the man move with such urgency before.
/Oh, gods below that's some good dick. Oh, I never want this to end! But I know you have other matters to attend to... finish it... cum for me. Yes, yes, I want it all, cum inside my twat. Fill me up with that demon seed!/
Nuru stepped up to the altar, praying for some relief, as well as his heavenly reward. His vision went white.
Hmm, Level Four. He chose a few skills and burned his spare EXP, hoping for a little more LCK. But it was not to be. Perhaps he needed to work on his karma. He left the altar.
/Oh, yes, oh - oh - oh- o*
Something clicked in Nuru's head, and the voice went suddenly silent. He sat down on a prayer rug and waited, enjoying the blessed moment of peace. Several minutes later, Father Emeka came back, panting and wheezing, carrying some kind of box.
"Nuru... oh thank the gods."
He coughed, wheezed a bit, then straightened up a bit and made his way up the aisle.
"Father, are you alright?"
Nuru got up to walk with him.
"Fine... fine. Glad to see you're still here. Nuru, we need to talk."
"We do? About what?"
"Inside... this reliquary... is a powerful artifact. I have held it for many long years... awaiting this day. Come, sit."
"I don't understand. It's getting late, I should-"
"No, Nuru, this cannot wait. I should have guessed earlier that you were playing with forces beyond your control. What once I thought to be harmless fun, I now see has turned into a very dangerous circumstance. You have been touched by a demon."
"Father, everything's fine. She can't touch me, I have no MP to manipulate."
"My son, demons are more clever than you give them credit for. Let me show you. Give me this one chance to prove it to you. It will take a little time, but have faith. Stay within the shelter of the Sanctuary Temple, where the artifact will protect you."
"With you? Father, are asking me to become a priest?"
"Nuru, I am not a Demon Hunter, but I spent many years preparing to be one. Trust me, I can see the aura on you clearly now. I was proven the more correct by suppressing the connection with this artifact, which is draining me and will not last but a few hours. Nuru, tell me the truth. Did you give a demon your name?"
"I... yes."
"I am a soulsmith, albeit a low level one. I can change your name, your true name. You must do this now."
"What is going on, Father? Why?"
"I will show you. Please, do this first. You may keep Nuru as a nick, for casual conversation, but you must find something longer, more secure. Do not give this out, ever, except to one you trust above all others, and only for the purpose of Resurrection, should you ever be able to afford it."
Nuru nodded. The priest closed his eyes, held out a hand with a stone in it, and an ethereal square floated between them bearing the runes that made up his name. He could not bear to change it completely; he added a few vowel runes, and then some complexity runes and numerals to the end. He selected the symbol to make it so. He felt a subtle shift inside himself, and then Father Emeka slammed his palms together.
"!Mafi Girma Jiko Suna Nuru!" he intoned, his voice booming powerfully through the building, making Nuru's hair stand up.
He held out a hand to show the quartz in his hand, glowing with inner light.
"This is all that remains of your old True Name. Come with me."
They walked out the side exit to the barren ground where the wood was chopped for the funereal pyres. An old oven that marked the first kitchen that had been build here was just beyond.
"This is the edge of sanctified ground. Watch."
The priest tossed the quartz crystal high into the air. As it soared back down to the ground outside the temple, a red spot flared on the ground and then a torrent of liquid fire erupted and burst into several diverging streams that cooled the further they went, forming hollow antlers that bubbled and spat and grew more slowly at the ends until they did nothing more than glow a dull red, thrusting high into the air and bending outward in all directions. The smell of sulfur filled the air, and what little grass had been there withered and smoked, crumbling to ash. At the end of each antler, embedded in the glowing-coal-colored ends, was embedded a small piece of glowing quartz that flickered and faded to darkness.
"Gods above..." Nuru said.
"You were targeted. Either the demon you spoke to, or another they sold it to, cast an Infernal Ritual meant to kill you."
"I... was such a fool."
"Nuru, when I was your age, I dreamed of having that influence. I thought I would put such a fear into the demons that they would all know my name, all be bent to the singular purpose of my destruction. They were the idle fantasies of youth, of course. But whatever you've done has stirred them mightily. I can do little but applaud you, though I hope I have impressed upon you the importance of caution."
"Yes. Yes, you have. Thank you, Father."
"This is my purpose in this life, my son. No thanks are needed. I knew the youth were most vulnerable to such influences, and this is why I have stayed here in the low-level area, away from all hope of fame or glory, though my heart has yearned for it always."
"There is clearly much more I need to learn."
"There is a man I know. Go and see him."
"I will."
But damned if he wasn't still hard as a rock, remembering every moan and sigh of the succubus with perfect clarity. Father Emeka offered him a prayer rug to sleep on, which he accepted. Though highly conflicted about imagining the succubus that had just tried to kill him, he nevertheless had to masturbate to fall asleep.
