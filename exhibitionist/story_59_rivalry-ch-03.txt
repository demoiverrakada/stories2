Chapter 3: Sacrificing for a Damsel in Distress
We had a quick breakfast and then proceeded to do some quick shopping to buy my swimwear.
Frederick was wearing the same Khaki Bermuda that he wore on the first day and a loose fitting sleeveless grey top. I wore the same outfit I wore on the first day since I only brought along my bikini bottom. Cassandra wore a micro tube which left the area above her shoulders bare and exposed a huge portion of her midriff. It was at this time that I found she has some baby fat left. Overall, she has fats around parts of her body that accentuated her curves unlike me who has less than 5% fats due to my rigorous exercise regime. She wore an extremely tight gold mini skirt below and a pair of gold snickers.
"Morning all," Frederick greeted us warmly.
"Good morning."
"Morning all. Aei, Ruth, not wearing yesterday's outfit ah?"
"Frederick said cannot leh," I giggled.
"Har, how to wear yesterday's outfit?" Frederick answered frowningly.
=================================================================================
We arrived at a shop selling swimwear and I began to search for one suitable for me. They only sold very conservative bikinis or one piece. Flashy colours like pink and orange as well as white were all sold out.
I had to settle for a conservative ordinary looking black coloured bikini. I tried it on and it looked -- well ordinary on me. It even conservatively hid my "landing strip" as it was not low-rise cutting.
"Frederick and Cassandra, you all not buying ah?"
"No lah. I got bring a lot of clothing, unlike someone."
"I have. I brought my beach shorts."
I paid promptly and we left the place. We settled on an old run-down coffee shop for lunch then made our way back to the resort. We all agreed to meet at 2:30pm at the beach.
===============================================================================
Frederick was there when I arrived. He was dressed in a colourful blue beach board shorts with designs of corals, clams, starfish, jellyfish, interspersed through the design. I came in that new black conservative bikini that I have just bought.
"Where is that girl? Forever the last one. She must make a grand entrance one leh," I sounded irritatingly.
"Hahaha. True." Frederick answered as he stole glances at me.
"She will come dressed to surprise us all. Or maybe she will come not dressed to surprise us all."
"Har, you all discussed ah? She really going to be topless like you?" Frederick answered with a concerned look.
"If she dares, why not?"
"Hello everyone. So sorry I am late. Need time to dress up."
Cassandra's bikini shocked both Frederick and me. I thought only Ang Mohs dared to wear such bikini. It was a gold-cloured micro mini. The bottom was so small, it just literally covered her clit. If you looked hard enough, you can see her lips swallowing up her bikini. Unlike me, she was clean shaven. Her butts were exposed completely. The only trace was some faint gold-coloured string peeping out from between those buns.
The top was even worse. It was so small it could hardly contain her ample assets. I also got a better picture of Cassandra's body. She still harboured some amount of baby fats but in the right place. She was definitely much curvier than me and might be a little "fleshy" by some other people's standard. Her tummy was not tight, nor does it show any hint of a 6-pack but definitely not fat either.
"Er...your nipple a little exposed liao."
I was sure I saw a small tent forming in Frederick's shorts.
"That one is not nipple lah. It is called areola. You never study biology meh?
No wonder you take so long to dress up lah. Cannot fit into the bikini. Too big liao."
For the first time, I saw Cassandra blushed. She hastily adjusted her bikini top.
"That's the only one I have."
Frederick's eyes did not leave Cassandra for even a second. He just stood there and stared. The tent rising.
"Frederick, your nose."
Frederick instinctively touched his nose. "Why, what's wrong with my nose?"
"It is bleeding." I laughed as I completed the sentence. Frederick shot a 'wah biang' look at me.
Ever so often, with the slightest movement, Cassandra's areolas would show as the bikini stretched to try to contain her assets.
Although I sounded normal. Deep in mind, the score flashed, Ruth: 1 Cassandra: 2. I would need to up the ante to equalize the score again.
We played in the sea for a while, splashing water at each other whilst Frederick attempted to master a complete somersault in mid-air.
From a distance, we saw three Ang Mohs playing water basket ball. There were two erected poles with baskets rising out of the water on each end. As they approached us, all their eyes rested on Cassandra.
"Hi guys, wanna join us for a game of water basket ball. Just nice 3 vs 3." His eyes never left Cassandra.
Having been in the water for so long, Cassandra has forgotten about her bikini. Both her areolas showed prominently. The Ang Mohs were all visually raping Cassandra.
As a fellow female, I wanted to protect her, to remind her that her areolas were being displayed for the whole world to enjoy. But on second thought, I felt she might like the attention and the excitement of bringing lust onto ordinary boys.
As we played. It was obvious we had the upper hand. Both Frederick and I were more athletic and our training gave us the upper hand in terms of speed and endurance. When the ball was with Frederick or I, one of the Ang Mohs would "guard" us and attempt to snatch the ball away from us.
However, when Cassandra caught hold of the ball, they would all swarm towards her, pretending to try to snatch the ball but actually taking the opportunity to caress her body. Cassandra was forced under the water various times by the boys.
We could all see that Cassandra was in agony. She was catching her breath, choking and coughing trying very hard to be in the game. I caught a glimpse of her red eyes. It could be a side effect of her fighting for breath whilst underwater or she was in tears from the agony. She was also very silent throughout the game. Even at one point, the Ang Mohs were so rough that one of her entire breast was left exposed. Instead of quickly covering herself up, she was fighting real hard to catch her breath; coughing constantly throughout.
Somehow the entire event hit a soft spot in me. As much as we were rivals, I pitied Cassandra as she was not as fit as I was. I came up mentally with a plan to save her and at the same time equalize the score.
When no one was looking I reached behind my bikini top and loosened the knot. I next signalled for Frederick to throw me the ball. In possession of the ball, I waited for one of the Ang Mohs to approach me. When he caught up with me and attempted to snatch the ball from me, instead of throwing it to Frederick or Cassandra which was often the plan, I pretended to struggle with him.
Both of us struggled under water and he managed to snatch the ball away from me. When I rose up from the water, every one was in shock. The top part of my bikini has completely come loose exposing both my breasts. The Ang Mohs called for a time out.
"Hey time out, time out. Let her recover."
Instead, I did something that shocked everyone. I untied the bottom strap and tore the entire bikini away from my body.
I consciously took deep breaths to calm myself down. It is one thing to be topless in front of your personal friends but another thing to be topless and vulnerable in front of complete strangers.
"This is getting in my way. It will come loose again even if I managed to tie it back now. You all don't mind I play this way."
I waded to the edge of the play zone and put my bikini top onto the rock. My hands were trembling from both embarrassment and excitement. Luckily my back hid this sight from the rest.
"Definitely not. If that is what you are comfortable to play in," one of the Ang Mohs enthusiastically replied.
Frederick and Cassandra looked on in shock at me.
"Cool. Let's continue."
I don't know whether that was a right move but over the course of the next hour, I endured one of the worst humiliation and pushed my stamina to the limit. I swore I would have drowned if it was not for my Dragon Boat training.
Every time I have the ball, they would all swarm towards me. Even when they managed to snatch the ball from me and instead of going towards the pole to score, they were more interested in groping me all over. I would feel hands groping me from everywhere. Whenever I struggled to rise to the surface, a hand would force me back underwater. The pain and humiliation were terrible. Some of the hands were more than groping, they were clawing at me. Hands also touched my private area multiple times.
I understood how Cassandra must have felt. I have to go through this pain and humiliation. If I put back my bikini top, they would definitely target Cassandra.
Finally it was all over. We won by 3 points and everyone was tired. I was utterly exhausted and out of breath; breathing heavily and my breasts rising and falling with each breath I took. The Ang Mohs claimed that they had an appointment and rushed off. I wade to retrieve my bikini top. Before I could put it on, the emotional build-up took a toll on me and I broke down into tears. Frederick and Cassandra rushed over.
Frederick concerningly asked, "You alright?"
"Yeah. They were too rough and I swallowed a lot of water. They kept pushing me down."
"Oh gosh, Ruth, look at yourself."
"Why? Where?"
Frederick who was looking at me with concern. "You have scratches everywhere. Bruises too."
I looked at my own body and I truly have scratches everywhere. Scratches were on my breasts, tummy, shoulders. There were several bruises on my body too. I was like an amazonian warrior, victorious after a vicious death-duel.
I put on my bikini top to make it to shallower water to inspect my legs. Lo and behold, there were scratches and bruises everywhere too.
In a genuinely concerned tone, Cassandra asked, "Is it painful?"
"No. If you haven't pointed it out to me, I wouldn't have noticed it. So no, no feeling at all."
Cassandra looked apologetic. She seemed to guess that I've gone through the ordeal on her behalf probably knowing at her fitness level, she would never have survived.
Ruth: 2 Cassandra: 2
==================================================================================
Back in our room, we showered and changed. I put on my bikini bottom. A shout came from Cassandra.
"Hey they have free laundry every day. We can wash two pieces of free laundry every day. I want to wash my top."
"Me too. I call Housekeeping. You pass to them ok?"
"I am going to bathe. You bathed already, just pass to them when they come."
"How to? I am topless, you forgot?"
"Hey please lah. Almost everyone in this resort has seen you topless. Housekeeping seeing you topless won't change a thing."
I rolled my eyes at that exaggerated claim even though Cassandra couldn't see me. Before I could argue, the door bell rang. I plucked up my courage, thrusted my chest out, took a deep breath, took the package we pre-packed with our to-wash clothes and walked to the door.
I opened the door and it was a lady. She looked at me with surprise but pretended nothing out of the ordinary. She collected the package from me and promptly disappeared.
"Ding Dong", came the door bell again. "Who is it this time?" I thought to myself.
I opened the door and Frederick was standing at the door. Although I was perfectly fine topless in front of both Cassandra and him, he has not gotten used to it yet.
When the door opened, he stared at my chest and looked me up from top to bottom. "Gosh, you really have a nice body."
"Oh thank you. Bye." I pretended to close the door.
"Wait wait, let me in."
"I thought you came over to just tell me this."
"Hey I thought we are going to the pub tonight."
And then I remembered. "Arrrgghhh..." I exclaimed.
"Why? What's wrong?"
"I sent my only top to laundry."
By this time, Cassandra has finished her shower. She was dressed in a panty and another diy crop top. The only similarity with her previous diy crop top was the length. It was as short and continued to expose her bra.
I thought Cassandra would be comfortable to go topless or even minimally braless at this juncture but she remained quite "conservatively" dressed.
"Why? What happened?"
"Ruth said she washed her only top."
"Oh yah. We just sent our top to the laundry. She still has her jeans what..."
"Hey hey, cannot go with jeans and topless ok."
Cassandra laughed out loud then continued, "Wear bikini top lor. It is a resort what."
Trying to act brave, "My bikini top is still wet and I am sure yours is too."
"I have an extra bikini."
She rummaged through her luggage and pulled out a brown pair of bikinis. She threw the bottom back into the luggage.
From afar, the bikini top looked decent. "Hey I need the bottom too. I don't want to go commando today."
When she handed me the bikini, I realized that it was a micro mini similar to the one she has worn in the morning. She has brought two pairs.
I was silent for a while, running through in my mind whether I should really go to a pub with a micro mini bikini. Besides the scratches and bruises on my body might elicit a different kind of what had happened from people.
"You hiao ah, bring so many pairs of bikinis?"
"Hey last time my bikini broke during holiday you know. I couldn't join any of the beach outing thereafter. Now wiser already. I also not so daring to be topless mah.
You want to go or not? If you pai sei, I will go with Frederick, you stay here."
The thought of her spending time with Frederick boosted my courage. Without going through the logical mind, I blurted a "Yes."
Cassandra wore her micro-denim shorts and a very tight t-shirt. She was struggling to get into the t-shirt. When she finally succeeded, it left a large part of her midriff exposed.
"How come they sell women shirts all so small size one?"
"This one is from my 5-year old cousin."
Frederick gave a look of disbelief by widening his eyes.
==============================================================================
The pub was dimly lit. However, one thing I failed to consider was that my attire provided little warmth in that freezing environment. I was shivering from the air condition blasting away at my naked skin. Even my jeans offered little to protect my legs from the cold let alone the bikini.
I was left with no choice. I looked pleadingly at Frederick and whispered, "I am very cold, can you keep me warm?"
Almost immediately, I could feel him putting an arm on my shoulder.
"Idiot, cuddle lah, like that how to keep me warm?" I thought to myself. I pulled myself closer to him. We remained in this pose throughout the evening.
Mid way through, he plucked up the courage to run his hands across my naked skin -- my shoulders and love handles. And I could feel electricity running across my body.
"Is that what they called electricity?" I silently thought.
Cassandra was very quiet. She sat there by herself opposite us, enjoying the music, her drinks, the peanuts and her own silent thought.
We finally left the place at around 12 midnight.
============================================================================
As we were walking back to the resort, Cassandra suddenly shouted out, "Girl, your nipples are exposed."
I looked down and indeed both my nipples were peeping out of my small triangular bikini.
I thrust out my chest, and said with a smile "Nice?"
I was bolstered by my days of being naked and loved this feeling and people's admiration of my hard worked body. In fact, I was feeling so sexy and horny, I wanted to strip my top off but there were too many people walking on the pathway that we were on. I feel an aching between my legs.
Frederick didn't say anything but I observed a rising tent in his jeans. I also saw a couple of people squinting their eyes in the darkness to have a better look at me. They must have caught sight of my exposed nipples.
Throughout the walk back, I also saw Cassandra stealing glances at me, particularly at my breasts.
And so the second day passed. Ruth: 3 Cassandra: 2
