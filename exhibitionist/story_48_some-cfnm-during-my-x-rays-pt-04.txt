This is a continuation of a previous story about my experience injuring my hip, getting some scans down and a massage as well. I recommend reading the previous chapters first.
~~~
On Friday morning I leaned back in my chair at the office and gazed out the window. I thought back on some of the events of the last couple of weeks while I drank my second coffee that day. Recently I had visited an imaging clinic for some scans which led to several erotic encounters with a receptionist, a nurse and a doctor. Afterwards, I took up an offer for a massage from the receptionist at the clinic who also moonlighted as a masseuse.
That massage had taken things to a new level. It was an extremely sensual massage and not only did I have sex with Lisa the mature and sultry brunette massseuse but on top of that, we were unexpectedly observed by Sandie, the nurse from the clinic, during the act. Possibly even more shocking was the realisation that Lisa had planned for Sandie to witness this as she was trying to help Sandie understand what she was missing in her sex life. According to Lisa, Sandie's fiancé was fairly diminutive in comparison to my exceptionally well endowed 9" tool.
I left that night unsure of what would happen next and I had not yet heard from either women since then. However, I was eager to see either of them again. Even the slightest thought of booking another massage triggered a rise in my cock and the thought of having the opportunity to give Sandie a level of satisfaction she had likely never experienced before was also tantalising.
The time was now just after 11am and I realised two things: I should probably get some work done today and, secondly, having had two coffees and a protein shake after the gym this morning meant my bladder needed some release. I sat up out of my chair and shook my head with a bit of a chuckle as I let go of my musings.
As I walked down the corridor towards the bathrooms I noticed my penis, while still flaccid, was feeling particularly thick and heavy due to my earlier thoughts.
I turned a corner and arrived at the entrances of the respective men and women's bathrooms. I nearly reached the men's door when the women's door opened and a woman stepped out with a look of frustration on her face.
"Oh, Sam, hey!" The woman said to me. I paused mid-step and looked at her. It was Veronica, a young new hire who - to be honest - I hadn't interacted with much yet.
Although, looking at her right now I thought I should definitely try to talk to her more as she was looking particularly stunning today. She was a reasonably tall woman at around 5'9" and today she wore red heels, a short dark grey skirt, a white blouse that had a few buttons open and a cute blazer which matched her skirt. She was curvy in all the right places with long wavy strawberry blonde hair that fell to her shoulders. At around 24, fresh out of university, her measurements reminded me of the large breasted mature receptionist Lisa. Again I felt another stirring in my loins.
"It is Sam right?" She added, interrupting my thoughts.
I chuckled "Haha. Hey. Yes, I'm Sam. What's up?" I said briefly.
"This is really embarrassing..." she started to explain and then added "but one of the stalls in the women's bathroom is shut for repairs. And someone else is using the other stall and she's taking forever... I am really busting to go because I've been doing this stupid lemon water vegan cleanse the last 24 hours." She explained while visibly squirming.
She quickly added her request, "Do you think anyone will care if I pop into the men's? Is there anyone in there?"
I could see her discomfort and could tell this was both painful and awkward for her. "Oh, no one will care. I'm about to go too. Let me scout ahead though." I said with a wink.
I took a few more quick steps and pushed open the door to the men's bathroom with my right hand. Leaning inside I quickly saw that it was empty. Just one stall in the corner with a door ajar and two urinals to my right.
I twisted my head back over my left shoulder and said "Hey come on in, coast is clear."
She smiled excitedly and stepped forward. "Oh thank god" she said as she walked into the room, brushing past me as I kept the door open with my right arm extended and my back against the door. Her perfume hit me and I couldn't help but notice it was very sensual, like a mixture of coconut milk and orange. My cock pulsed and unfurled an extra half inch after this discovery.
She rushed into the stall and I let go of the door. In less than a second I heard her start emptying her bladder and a loud exhale of relief that almost sounded like a moan.
I was about to step up to the urinal and begin relieving myself as well, when I noticed that my hand had gotten sticky from something while holding the door. Not wanting to touch my junk with god knows what, I quickly washed and dried my hands first.
I rolled back my white shirt sleeves, unzipped my grey suit pants and out snaked my sizable appendage. Due to my morning musings during coffee, my cock was still a little extra longer than its normal flaccid length, if I had to guess I'd say it was roughly 7 and a half inches long at this point and my balls were feeling heavy too.
I pointed down at the urinal and started my own stream going. Meanwhile I heard Veronica's stream starting to wind down. In an effort to defuse the awkwardness of just hearing our respective bodily processes I said "It's Veronica, right?" with a projection in my voice.
"Oh, yeah!" She responded back "I just joined the strategy team recently. Sorry, maybe I should've introduced myself before barging into your bathroom" she answered in a joking manner and I heard the toilet start to flush.
I laughed and replied back "You just joined and you're already shaking things up I see!" I leaned back slightly as I continued to comfortably empty my bladder into the urinal, holding my thick hose of a cock in my left hand and resting my right hand on my hip lazily.
The door from the stall opened and Veronica stepped out. Obviously she wasn't surprised to see me as we'd been chatting and she'd heard me using the facilities as well. I continued to mind my own business and thus did not turn to face her, I just focused on doing what I needed to do, the same thing she had been doing a moment earlier. Of course I was still aware of her on my periphery, towards my right-hand side I heard her step up to one of the sinks and start washing her hands, squirting some soap as well.
Several seconds passed and my stream started to wane, I then realised that the tap at the sink had been running for longer than I expected and Veronica didn't seem to have moved. I started to turn my head to the right out of curiosity and at that moment I realised two things.
Firstly, due to her position at the sink, the position of the mirror in the room and her current angle, she had a clear sight of my cock happily hanging out of my pants in all its glory.
Secondly, the sight of my flaccid yet impressively large package had caused her to freeze up. She stood there staring through the reflection straight at my groin as she continued to absently rub her hands together under the running water. She honestly seemed to be lost in a dream.
I would've zipped up by now but I was waiting for the last of my bladder to empty. And while I curious how long she would unabashedly stare at the penis of her senior colleague I decided it wasn't worth the risk of someone else walking into the bathroom and creating a fuss about the situation.
As the last drops came out of dick I twisted my body to the right ever so slightly and lightly coughed "Ahem" I said. "You alright there Veronica? You really going to let that go to waste?"
Her eyes flicked from my cock up to my face, still looking at me through the reflection. Her mouth gaped in a slight shock as her eyes closed and her face screwed up in embarrassment. "Oh fuck I'm sorry. I-" she stammered and then turned around to look at me. She pried her eyes open into a squint but kept her focus on my face. "Wait... What did you say?" she added.
My flow was finished but I still needed to shake some drops off my dick before packing it away. So I just gave it two good flicks and repeated myself "I said, are you really going to let that go to waste?"
Her face was frozen again as she struggled to process my meaning. Her mouth still a little agape, her eyes lowered back down to the veiny monstrosity I was casually holding in my left hand. "I-" she started to say, before I finally packed my package away into my pants and zipped up.
"I meant the water. You're wasting the water, you know?" I explained, while nodding in the direction of the sink behind her with the tap still running.
"OH!" she exclaimed while closing her eyes again. "Shit yeah." she swore and turned around to turn off the tap. She paused and then gripped each side of the sink, staring down at the drain in embarrassment.
I relaxedly walked up to the other sink and briefly washed my hands, grabbing a sheet of paper towel to dry my hands and offering another piece to her. "Hey. It's okay." I said calmly, and added jokingly, "Most men normally have one you know. It's a little secret of us guys."
"...little?" she said with a bemused look.
"Well..." I started to say.
"Trust me. Most men don't have one... quite like that" she smiled widely, seemingly regaining her composure. Then she looked me deeply in the eyes while continuing "...and something tells me that's not a little secret to you."
I chuckled and said "Okay. Guilty as charged."
She laughed as well, looking down, blushing a little and biting her lower lip.
"Maybe we should step out of here..." I suggested while gesturing.
"Yeah... probably. Otherwise who knows what I'll see next." she joked and I laughed.
As we exited the bathroom she said "Well, it was good getting to know you better Sam..."
"Likewise..." I replied "You never know who the voyeurs are among us" I said playfully.
"Hey!" she said with a pout.
I just winked at her and said "Don't worry. I enjoyed it."
She mock-punched me in the shoulder as we continued to walk down the corridor.
Finally we reached my office and paused. She turned to me and said "So... maybe... next time you can watch." she said with a smirk. "Until then, you can watch this." and she turned around and walked away, sensually swaying her hips and knowingly showing off her plump but firm looking ass to me as I stared after her.
I shook my head lightly and re-entered my office. Sitting back down at my desk I noticed a message on my phone.
## Hey big boy.. a friend is throwing a party tonight. Interested? Sandie will b there ;)
I quickly realised it was from Lisa, the masseuse, and smiled. I typed a response:
## Hey Lisa, sounds cool ;-) what time?
She responded:
## Yeah. It will it's gonna b good. Party should be buzzin by 9 and u can bring someone if u want. Might make sandie a bit jealous ;)
I smirked and we worked out a few more details.
The rest of the day went by without much hassle. I dealt through a few work tasks as usual. Although I couldn't help but notice that when I stepped out for lunch or to grab a drink from the office kitchen that a couple of the women from the office were a little bit flirtier with me than normal. I had a feeling that Veronica might have mentioned our encounter to some of the other girls.
I'd worked at this office for several years but I hadn't fooled around with many colleagues. I guess the "cat is out of the bag" I thought to myself. More like "cock is out of the bag" another voice in my head said. I laughed to myself as I headed to the elevator at the end of the day.
It was empty and I stepped inside. I was pressing the button when I heard someone rushing around the corner to catch it too. I quickly changed to hitting the "open" button instead and successfully kept it from closing when suddenly Veronica appeared in the gap of the door. "Hey!" she said and then saw me and grinned, repeating more enthusiastically "Oh hey!!"
She stepped inside "Thanks! Well, well... we meet again" she said while gesturing provocatively with her eyebrows.
"Hey" I simply said with a smile.
Veronica relaxed against another wall of the elevator and looked around innocently. I decided to play it cool.
I noticed her glance down at my crotch and then back up at my eyes and smiled.
"Oh by the way..." she started to say while casually opening her purse with one hand and then partially revealed something red. I turned and saw that she'd revealed a frilly pair of lingerie while she continued "...after this morning they were so soaked I actually had to take them off..."
I smirked and lifted my eyebrows a little "I like the colour" I said and she smiled back. Thinking back to Lisa's texts, I had an idea. "Want to go to a party tonight?" I said.
Veronica had a mix of surprise and intrigue in her eyes. "Sure..." she said.
"Cool." I said. We exchanged numbers and I told her I'd pick her up beforehand. As we went separate ways she flashed a smile.
When I got home I showered and cleaned myself up. I decided to dress smart casual for the night, not really knowing exactly what the party would be like. But I noticed the address was in a pretty fancy area so this seemed like a good idea.
I headed out and picked up Veronica. She was dressed to kill in a red dress that lifted her amazing breasts up and the same red heels from today. She was gorgeous and I was excited to see where the night might lead.
We arrived out front and discovered it was indeed a fancy neighbourhood and the house matched that fanciness. From the outside it looked like a two storey mini mansion and the garden even had a fountain. We could hear music playing inside and we rang the bell.
A few moments later we saw a shadow behind the frosted glass of the front door and shortly after it opened wide. A beautiful older woman greeted us with a look of curiosity. She had to be late 40s, around 5'10", slightly grey golden hair, a thin but elegant body wearing a blue dress with a set of pearls around her long neck. She flashed a gorgeous smile.
"Well hello!" she said. "Let me guess..." and she studied me for a moment. "Sam?"
"Wow, I'm famous it seems." I responded with a smile.
"Or possibly infamous." she quipped back with a devilish grin. "And Sam is accompanied by...?
"Veronica, it's a pleasure to meet you." replied my date.
"Wonderful. Lisa mentioned you might be joining us. I believe she's in the hot tub at the moment. My name is Miranda Herrington. Welcome to my humble abode! Would you care for a glass of champagne?" The lady of the house gestured us inside. For some reason my mind registered that there was some significance to her name.
We happily agreed and entered.
It was indeed a mansion. Complete with an open lounge and kitchen space with high ceilings and doors that opened out to the backyard which included a pool and the aforementioned hot tub. All up I'd say there were 30 to 40 people buzzing around. Some in swim gear, some dressed simply smartly. There was even a lawn with a mini putting green and some older gentlemen were enjoying a little bit of golf.
Miranda showed us to the kitchen and grabbed two glasses for us. "So tell me about yourselves. How did you meet Lisa?" She asked while pouring.
"Well, actually Lisa gave me a massage treatment as I've recently been dealing with an injury." I explained. Then gesturing to Veronica I added "and Veronica and I work together at a private architecture and design agency."
"Oh you're an architect?" Miranda asked.
"Yes, although I more oversee the projects and pitch the proposals at the moment." I added.
"Fascinating. I should introduce you to—" Miranda was cutoff by the door bell ringing again. "Ah. Duty calls. I'll be back in a moment." she winked and disappeared.
"This place is incredible..." Veronica whispered to me.
"I know," I said. "By the way. You're dressed perfectly."
She looked at me and smirked and repeated my line back to her "I know" she said.
"Oh it's no trouble, I was just pouring some glasses for some other guests!" Miranda was saying as she returned to us, leading the new arrivals. "Sam and Veronica. I'd like you to meet Sandie and Rob!"
Miranda revealed another couple. One half of whom I knew - Sandie the nurse from the clinic - the friend and coworker of Lisa.
"Sam!" Sandie exclaimed with surprise. Her partner was slightly taken aback by the strength of the reaction.
"Oh you all know each other?" Miranda laughed.
"Not all of us." I said.
We then proceeded to make some introductions. As we did I looked at Sandie and Rob. She was dressed in a simple but fashionable black jumpsuit dress-like outfit with an opening down the front and what appeared to be no visible bra. The back of the dress was open and she looked stunning with her auburn hair and dazzling green eyes.
Rob on the other hand was dressed in a blue shirt and jeans. No belt. He didn't seem to have put in a lot of effort. He was also only a little taller than Sandie. Probably no more than 5'6" it seemed. He was slim but not seemingly muscular in any way.
I couldn't help but notice Sandie was analysing Veronica a fair bit. She seemed to be curious about our relationship to one another.
Suddenly Miranda called someone over "John! Come here there's someone I want you to meet!"
A tall, strong but older 60 year old man strode over to join us. "John this is Sam." I shook his hand, he had a confident grip.
"Good to meet you Sam." John said.
Miranda added "He's an architect!"
"He is, is he?" John added rhetorically. "My company works with architects from time to time."
Suddenly a lightbulb went off in my head "You're John Herrington," I simply said.
"Damn straight. Are you psychic boy?" John smiled.
I laughed "No, but I just realised my firm pitched your company on the Plateau project."
"Ah..." John said. "And I take it from the tone of your voice that you're not from McHale's. You didn't win the pitch?"
"No, we didn't. Actually I wasn't part of the pitching team at that point but I wish I had been." I said.
"Tell me about it," John said with curiosity. He pulled me into a conversation and we talked shop for several minutes. I explained my thoughts on the project and the decisions that were taken. I also explained how I had concerns over the approach McHale was taking.
"Well Sam... maybe you are psychic..." he said more seriously. "The project isn't going well actually and I have been regretting our choice. I wish you'd been in that pitch to be honest."
He looked into the distance pensively.
"Sam." He started slowly. "Give me your card. And let me think a bit more. It might be too late to undo this but my firm has another project on the horizon. Even bigger than Plateau. I think maybe you are the right man for it."
I was amazed. If this led to us winning a contract with Herrington it could turn the whole firm's prospects around. We shared contact details and John left us to go entertain more guests.
After he walked away I turned to see Veronica staring at me with a mixed look of disbelief and lust. Clearly impressed she leaned to my ear and whispered. "That was fucking incredible... You have no idea how much I want to ride your massive cock right now you sexy business god." she said.
I nearly gulped but regained my composure. It was a turn on to hear her be so blunt. Clearly the champagne had some effect and the thought of having her on top of me sent blood running to my manhood. I felt my cock begin to unfurl a bit.
We rejoined Sandie, Rob and Miranda to find them admiring a large painting hanging against the wall. It was of a tall, muscular naked man posing with one foot propped up onto a chair, he was staring pensively into the distance. The colours were very dynamic with dark shadows around the man and his body painted in a dark red colour.
However, the most striking element of the piece was the man's impressively large genitals. His cock was hanging flaccidly and appeared to be around 8 and a half inches in length. His balls were large as well and clean shaven. Strangely, on top of the painting was a semi-transparent black sheet of glass positioned directly over the man's penis and testicles. It appeared to have been added on top of the painting and fixed in place with transparent screws as well.
"Oh my, what do we have here?" Veronica said as we joined the group.
"We were just admiring this piece that Miranda painted." Sandie said.
"Wow. You painted this?" I said, genuinely impressed.
"Yes, life drawing is a pastime of mine that I've been developing for several years." Miranda began to explain, "I also help organise a life drawing class amongst an affluent group of women I'm connected with. We even have a yearly charity session at which the pieces are sold to raise money to fight sex trafficking."
"Amazing. I love the colours and the black glass is an interesting touch." I added.
"Oh yes? Why thank you Sam. That's very kind." Miranda responded. "And yes, the black glass is meant to symbolise society's censorship of the naked form. However I kept it semi-transparent to communicate the idea that certain men cannot be constrained. They should not be castrated - so to speak."
"Yeah... it'd be a real shame to censor such a healthy specimen as that..." Veronica added cheekily.
Miranda laughed lightly, and said "Indeed". She then paused and added "Have you ever done any modeling, Sam? You seem to be quite fit. It might suit you." she tilted her head elegantly with the question. My eyes wandered to Veronica and Sandie's reactions. They both looked bemused to see what my response would be.
I chuckled and started trying to think of a smart response "Ahh..." I said.
However, I was saved by an interruption. "Well hello everyone" a husky familiar voice said. On the topic of naked people, I turned around to find a semi-naked woman in a bikini walking up to us dripping with water. As she got closer I then recognised it was Lisa the masseuse. She appraised us all and winked at me upon noticing Veronica and that I had indeed brought a date.
"The hot tub is amazing. You should all join in!" Lisa added.
We laughed and Sandie said "You didn't mention a pool Lisa! Otherwise I would've brought a swimsuit," she said a little upset.
Miranda jumped in "Oh nonsense. You can all skinny dip if you like. It'll be our little secret!" She said but then added slightly quieter and closer to me "Or perhaps... big secret." As she added this she leaned into me and squeezed my ass from behind. My cock started to harden as I realised Lisa had clearly informed Miranda of my gifted appendage.
Rob added "I'm not sure..." with hesitation.
"Oh, don't fret Rob. I was only joking!" Miranda clarifier with a laugh. "Actually this happens fairly often when we have parties. So we have a bunch of spare swimsuits laid out upstairs and in the den. Anyone is welcome to join in honestly!"
Veronica seemed excited "Oh I looove hot tubs. Sandie, want to come and pick an outfit with me?" She said.
Sandie looked at Rob and then to me. And then back to Veronica "Okay sure."
"Wonderful. The ladies outfits are in the door on the left at the top of the stairs." Miranda said. "And boys are just back there in the den" she gestured down a corridor.
Rob and I looked at each other and shrugged. We started down the corridor and found the room. Although the stash of outfits had clearly diminished dramatically. There were only two pairs left. A pair of light blue shorts and a black speedo. "Shit..." Rob said, looking at the choices. "Should we flip for it?"
"Ah, to be honest, I am fine with either," I said.
"Dude. One is pretty embarrassing compared to the other." Rob explained.
"It's alright man. You want the shorts?" I suggested.
"Yeah. Well, if it's cool with you, then yeah. And you're a braver man than me dude!" he added.
I shrugged slightly.
We picked up our respective outfits and then looked at each other considering the privacy of changing in this room. We then came to the same decision at the same time and simply turned our backs to each other. We stepped out of our shoes and stripped off our clothes.
As I peeled off my underwear my cock sprang out and hung from me like a gargantuan banana. After Veronica and Miranda's comments my dick was hanging at a heavy 7 and half inches of flaccid but juicy length.
I then realised that there was some reflection in the window to my left. Luckily, no one was on the other side of the window of the den and it was dark out that side of the house. However, in the reflection I realised that Rob was sneaking a look at me as he was finishing pulling up his swim shorts. He could see the size of what I was carrying, his mouth was slightly agape and he quickly averted his eyes.
I promptly pulled up the tiny speedos and looked at the absurdity of my situation. The speedos barely concealed anything and in fact they effectively framed and showcased just how absurdly obscene my cock was.
At that point the door suddenly opened and Lisa appeared. "Boys! What's taking so long. Oh my..." She giggled at the sight of me. "Sam. Really?"
"These were the last left I swear." I honestly didn't want people thinking I was actually a pervert.
"Come on. The girls are waiting..." Lisa said with a laugh and disappeared.
'Moment of truth' I thought to myself and Rob and I marched back to the others.
Some of the crowd had thinned out but nearly everyone did a double take when they saw me walk into the room. Veronica licked her lips. Sandie just stared in shock. Miranda had a smirking smile and looked very interested. No one bothered to look at Rob.
I looked over Sandie and Veronica. Veronica wore a stringy, very revealing red bikini and g-string that showcased her incredible plump ass and tits. Her outfit would bring any man to his knees. Meanwhile Sandie wore a white one piece with a hole cut out around her stomach that showed off her toned physique, beautifully proportioned petite body and milky skin tone. She was stunning in an elegant way. Miranda was still dressed as she was, cleary not intending to join us in the tub.
"Shall we?" I simply said.
We walked out to the tub and luckily arrived as another young couple were getting out to leave, commenting that it was starting to get late. The woman was an absolutely stunning young blonde with a very elegant looking face, probably only 20 years old or so. She seemed to regret the decision to leave once she noticed the barely concealed weapon in my outfit. But her boyfriend dragged her away. At my last sight of her she was lightly biting her lower lip and looking at me seductively.
In the tub, the water was wonderful and we all relaxed instantly. We all sat in a circle facing one another, Veronica on my left, Sandie and Rob to my right. Across from me sat Lisa.
We laughed, drank wine and chatted about several topics as the evening drifted on. I learned that Sandie and Rob met during university and had been together for 5 years now. They hadn't fixed the date for the wedding just yet as they were still saving some money. It seemed to be a point of frustration for them.
At one point I started to feel something touching my ankles and begin to work its way up my calf. I quickly realised it wasn't an unintentional movement and I glanced down but could not see under the water due to the bubbles of the tub. I looked around the group and found Lisa grinning at me. I smiled back and finally the feet massaged their way up to my thighs. I felt the toes start to touch my groin and stroke my shaft. I separated my legs a bit more to give her extra access. The timid conversation had caused my cock to soften but now it was beginning to come alive again.
Unfortunately, this game was cut short when Miranda suddenly appeared. She had just said goodbye to more guests when she waltzed over. "Hope you're all enjoying the tub!" she said. She then walked up behind Lisa and whispered something in her ear.
Lisa simply smiled and turned to us. "I'm going to join Miranda everyone. If I don't see you later I hope you all had a great evening." She got up out of the tub, grabbed a towel and headed into the house with Miranda.
"I wonder what that was all about" Rob noted.
Veronica smiled with a bit of a knowing look. I felt she and I shared a similar theory. Sandie helped join the dots for Rob though, "I think Lisa and Miranda are going to have sex honey. Probably with John as well." she looked at him with a bemused look due to the fact he had not pieced it together.
"Oh right." Rob said with a chuckle.
There was a pause in the conversation and then Veronica asked "So... on that topic... has anyone... gotten it on... in a hot tub before?"
We all laughed. Rob and Sandie shook their heads. Veronica turned to me and I said "Maybe..." with a grin. It was true I'd had some fun during my university days. "I'll bet" she whispered to me and I started to feel her hand snake its way down to my groin.
The proposal of sex in the tub triggered me to realise the party had thinned out a lot by this stage. There was no one else left in the pool and just a few people still hanging out in the lounge.
Realising we had more privacy than I originally thought, I decided to see where Veronica was planning on taking this. I was already sitting with my arms extended out around the edge of the tub but I invited her further by pulling my thighs a little more apart. Her hand had been scratching my package through the speedo using her nails. A few seconds later she worked her fingers under the speedo and began to pull it aside, freeing the beast from its confinement. My cock and balls both popped out and her hand gripped around the base of my dick, she began to pump me.
Veronica kissed me passionately and I gripped the back of her head with my left hand. Pulling her in, our tongues worked against each other and she picked up the pace of her handjob.
I briefly let my eyes open and noticed Sandie and Rob were simply watching in silence. Clearly the passion on display was a lot more than what they were used to. Soon Veronica's movements with her hand became quite obvious as she started to use her whole arm in the process. She then knelt up and broke our kiss, facing me still she pivoted her body and legs around to sit on my lap. She let go with her hand and started to simply run her clit up and down my shaft, gripping my shoulders for stability and beginning to moan from the pleasure.
"Hey guys... come on." Rob simply said in a half-hearted protest. Sandie continued to stare in fascination.
Veronica turned to them and said "Sandie. Show your man a thing or two..."
Sandie stared at her as Veronica then took a hand down to her own pussy and pulled aside the fabric of the g-string bikini. I then felt her lift herself up to the tip of my now rock-hard 9 inch monster cock. The head of my penis now positioned at the entrance of her pussy I brought my hands to the thick juicy cheeks of her ass and together we slowly began to slide her down onto my manhood. With every inch she twisted and moaned more in pleasure. "Oooooh fuck..." she said as she finally reached the base and felt every inch of me inside her.
"Oh my god... I can't believe how big you are. Jesuuuss." she said while moaning. She then brought her hands down to her breasts and squeezed them together before pulling the flimsy bikini top off her body and over her head, tossing them behind me.
Rob and Sandie continued to stare. Rob clearly shocked at the effect my enormous cock he had briefly glimpsed earlier was having on this voluptuous woman. Something seemed to then click in Sandie's brain and without thinking she turned to her fiancé and started kissing him. Rob was surprised but kissed back and then even shocked surprised to find Sandie quickly pulling his shorts off of him. His cock was already rock hard at the vision of me fucking Veronica. The only sad part for Rob was that his penis was only 4 and a half inches in length, even at this full level of arousal. I knew this as - bizarrely - during my massage with Lisa a week earlier she had informed me that Rob was severely lacking in this department in comparison to myself.
Nonetheless, Sandie lifted herself up onto Rob's lap. She sank down onto his cock within a split second and started riding him as well. She was moaning from the entire experience although deep down she knew this wasn't everything it could be. She knew that her moans were not as genuine as Veronica's. "That's it baby" Sandie said to her partner. "Yeah. Fuck me honey."
My thrusting into Veronica was much stronger than Rob and Sandie's lovemaking though and it was obvious to both parties that I was a more physically powerful man than he was. Veronica bent down and bit my ear before saying "Lift me up. I want them to see you..." My eyes widened slightly at her suggestion but I was so intoxicated by the moment I didn't give a shit about preserving Rob's dignity. I effortlessly lifted Veronica up while still inside her, I pulled her even further towards me and she gasped in pleasure. She hooked her legs around me and I moved her up and down my shaft with my arms like a set of weights. My enormous rod pistoning in and out of her, I made my strokes long and slow. I saw that Rob was staring up at me gaping and Sandie had twisted herself around to stare in shock as well as water dripped off of me and Veronica.
Veronica pulled close to my ear again and whispered "Bring us closer to them. And bring me to Sandie." I was sweaty and simply nodded at her request. Taking a few steps I moved closer to Rob and Sandie, then I slowly half squatted and lowered Veronica down to be closer to Sandie. It was very difficult but I cradled her in my arms with my back bending over, her legs still clasped around me as I continued pumping into her. With my arms still wrapped around her back, she extended herself out as if she was laying down on a flat surface, her head fell backwards and she reached out to Sandie. It was awkward but she began to kiss Sandie while upside down. Their hands reached out to each other and held their faces to keep steady. Sandie continued to bounce up and down Rob. It was pleasurable for her but she wasn't anywhere near orgasm yet.
I saw Rob looked bewildered by the entire scene and he seemed to be struggling to control himself. Panting and screwing up his face to maintain his rhythm.
Watching Sandie and Veronica kiss made my cock swell even further and I started thrusting even more ferociously into Veronica. Suddenly her eyes bulged and her legs gripped me even further and she broke her kiss from Sandie to begin moaning like a wild animal. "Ooooh... fuuucck... yes... fuuckk me with that... monster... cooccck" she groaned out in between my deep thrusts into her pussy.
She started shuddering and spasming. Multiple orgasms began to ripple through her body and she shook like a puppet in my arms. She thrashed around in my arms, her hips and legs continuing to squeeze onto my cock. "Ooooooh GOD!" she screamed as the third orgasm hit her. Finally, her arms splayed out and she became heavy. Sandie looked on in awe.
"Oh fuck!!" Rob said suddenly. Sandie quickly snapped her attention to him "Noooo... Please don't honey." she said with a look of desperation on her face as she realised he was close to orgasm as well.
"I'm sorry honey!" he simply said and started shaking. He groaned and Sandie attempted to squeeze a bit more pleasure out of him as he inevitably shot his load into her. He pulled her closer to him and bowed his head into her breasts. She looked disappointed and started slowing down her movements as she felt his small penis begin to retract away from her.
Her face was looking down at him and she then turned back up to look at me. I was still inside Veronica as her body twitched in my arms. I slowly lifted her off my cock. My monstrous veined member now revealed and completely exposed to the cool air. Wet threads of pussy juice and precum hung between the tip of my cock and her pussy as I turned, lowered her down and placed her back in the tub to one side. She was exhausted but smiling contently to herself.
Rob was completely spent as well and sat crumpled. His head was hanging down with his chin on his chest. I turned back to Sandie and she stared at me and my massive cock. I looked at her with a genuine look of sympathy at the obvious disappointment she felt to not have had her own satisfaction. She looked almost on the verge of tears and I couldn't help but gape in shock that it all could have hurt her so much. She lifted herself off of Rob and jumped out the pool. Grabbing a towel and storming off into the house.
Although I hadn't orgasmed, the seriousness of Sandie's reaction had triggered me to lose some of my erection. I saw Rob pitifully yell out to her "Babe I'm sorry..." but he just sank back down and looked dejected.
Without thinking, I got out of the pool and grabbed a towel as well. I wrapped it around my waist and walked a few awkward steps before realising the discomfort of having my half hard cock twisting out of the side of these tiny speedos. I paused and quickly stepped out of the swimwear before tying the towel again around me and continuing after Sandie.
I entered the house and looked for her. There were a few stragglers around but they ignored me and I them.
Finally I saw a door ajar and a light on. I opened it to find Sandie in a bathroom, staring at herself in the mirror. She turned in surprise and then relaxed when she saw it was me. She looked down at the ground in resignation. I entered the room and closed the door behind me.
"What do you want?" she said, the towel was wrapped around her shoulders. She continued to stare at the ground.
"You" I simply said.
She slowly looked up at me and I stepped towards her. I opened my arms and she moved in closer to me. I held her and she placed her hands against my chest and leaned her forehead against me as well. I kissed the top of her head and she pressed up against me even more firmly. My cock began to rise to attention and it started to press against her abdomen - she shivered and then tilted her head up to me and we kissed. At first gently and then more passionately. An opening at the front of my towel came apart and my manhood appeared in front of her, pulsing its veins and quickly lengthening itself.
"Lock the door" she said. I turned and simply reached out to do so. As I turned back around to her she pulled the towel away from me and shed her own towel as well. She knelt down on the ground and took hold of my cock which was now completely erect and throbbing. Her hand began to stroke up and down my shaft as she brought her mouth to my testicles. She slowly sucked my balls one by one and then ran her tongue up towards the tip of my penis. Finally she opened her mouth wide and began to try to take me into her mouth and down her throat. She could only handle half of it before starting to struggle. I encouraged her to relax and she started to become more comfortable. She took more and more my cock into her and I ran my fingers through her hair, savouring this moment.
I decided I needed more though. I knew what I wanted to do to her. I wanted to watch her face contort as I sank inches of my meat into her pussy. I wanted to see her experience her first real cock. I began to pull her mouth away from my dick and pull her to her feet. "It wasn't good?" she asked me with worry.
I laughed and said "No Sandie. It was perfect." I then put my hands around her waist and lifted her with ease up and onto the bathroom counter, her face slightly surprised as she understood where I was taking this.
"Wait" she said, and then she started to take off her swimsuit from the shoulders, rolling it down her body and lifting her butt to let it come completely off and down her legs. She then leaned back and spread her legs for me. Her arms opened wide as well and she invited me to enter her.
My cock was now rock hard, still covered with juices from Veronica, my own precum, the water from the pool. I was at a full 9 inches, possibly a little more and so I slowly approached her to place the tip of my cock at the lips of her glistening pussy.
I placed myself there and said "Are you sure?" She looked at me and simply nodded, closing her eyes in preparation.
Slowly I started to sink my inches into her. Even my girth seemed to be overwhelming her. She shuddered in pleasure though and placed her feet behind me, pulling me in by my buttocks, she wanted more.
I continued sliding into her, at this point I think I was just halfway and I could see she was buckling with the feeling. I pushed another 2 inches into her. Now at just over 6 and a half inches she gasped. I eased out of her a bit, beginning a slow rhythm and she just gyrated in ecstasy at the sensations. Every push in I went deeper until I was at 8 inches at least. Her pussy was so tight but it wasn't a problem as her body was practically pouring fluids out to marinate my cock. Her body knew what was necessary and it cooperated.
"Oh holy fucking shit" she simply said, almost in tears. "This is what a real man feels like - oh fucking god...". My penis couldn't help but swell at her words, I felt pity for Rob but it didn't matter. I needed satisfaction and I needed to show this woman what she had been missing.
Finally I was completely inside her and her whole body was trembling. Her legs were wrapped around me and her arms as well. So far we had moved slowly to let her pussy adapt to the difference in size that she wasn't used to. Now I started to increase the rhythm and began more powerful thrusts. We looked at each other in the eyes and I watched her face contort with each thrust. Her tight pussy squeezed me as her hands grabbed my biceps for stability and I felt nails sink into my skin.
I picked up the pace and now I was wildly drilling into her. Her moans turned into wild animal sounds and she began practically screaming obscenities. I continued to plough into her. "Fuck me!!" she screamed. Our bodies moved back and forth in sync, I thrust into her and she squeezed me in deeper, lifting her pelvis towards me.
"Oh god... yes... yes!..." she started to say as the pressure built inside her.
The whole mirror and countertop was shaking with our movements. The floors were creaking and my thrusts were pounding the entire wall behind her.
Suddenly there was a panicked knocking at the door "Baby are you in there??" came the faint desperate sound of Rob's voice.
Sandie tried to respond but her voice was a garbled mess "Uuughhhargggh..." she said.
"Sandie honey? My love?" Rob pleaded and started pounding the door.
"Babyyy donnn't worrryyy... I'mmm okaaaaayyy..." Sandie responded as best as she could while moaning and shaking in her body from the feeling inside her.
Rob tried again "I'm sorry baby. I-" but then he was cut off as Sandie's body suddenly convulsed and her pussy clenched my cock again. Her eyes flew open and she looked at me "Oohohhh... OOOHHHHHH" she started to exclaim. "OOOHHH GOD!!" she screamed out now at the top of her lungs and threw her head back. I felt her body spasm as orgasms started to rip through her body. At the same time I could feel I was at a tipping point as well. Finally my cock, after all the teasing in front of Veronica this morning, the pent up sexual desires towards Sandie and then the incomplete orgasm in the tub culminated in me releasing myself inside of her. I erupted with an ungodly amount of cum that poured into her wanting pussy.
The feeling of my orgasm triggered more sensations inside her. After already shaking from having three orgasms flow through her body, feeling my cum filling her pussy and dripping out of her triggered another two waves of orgasms and her whole body shuddered again. She tightly gripped me with her arms and legs at the same time. She stayed like this for several seconds, her head bowing down and leaning against my chest.
Slowly she started to tremble less and catch her breath. She released the gripping of her hands, legs and pussy. Although tiny twitches still flickered over her even now.
The pounding of the door from her fiancé Rob had ceased. I imagined him on the other side of the door staring at disbelief at what he had heard.
"Thank you" Sandie softly whispered into my chest. Her body flinching yet again.
I slowly pulled out of her, with my cock no longer blocking it, her pussy began to leak and pour out her own juices and my cum. It looked like it could've filled a few cups but instead it just pooled onto the floor. She leaned back against the mirror, completely spent.
I stepped away and decided it was time for me to leave. Her eyes were closed in blissful contentment and without bothering to pick up my towel, I simply unlocked and opened the door.
Rob stood there in shock. His eyes looked down at my still humongous cock now hanging out in front of me, still leaking drops of cum and covered in his fiancé's fluids.
I looked down at him to discover he had clearly been in such a rush to confront the situation that he hadn't had the time to put his swim shorts back on after Sandie removed them. I briefly reviewed his manhood. It was shrivelled and barely looked like it had more than 3 inches in length to it. I didn't bother saying anything, he just stepped aside and let me walk past him with my cock swinging from side to side as I did so.
Returning to the living room I found Veronica dressed again and holding my clothes for me with a towel as well. I wiped myself off and got dressed. We left without saying a word.
I drove Veronica home and she gave me a passionate kiss on the mouth. At the same time she squeezed my cock with her hand through my pants. "Good night" was all she said to me and hopped out of the car.
Putting my hands on the wheel again, my feet found the pedals and I left.
