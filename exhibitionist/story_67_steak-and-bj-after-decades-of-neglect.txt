Chapter 1. One Wife, One Blowjob.
.
February 14th
My wife Violet, on her knees, was licking my balls and cock shaft, naked over my lowered breeches.
I was sitting on the couch in the living room, with my shirt unbuttoned.
Suddenly the doorbell rang.
I thought, "Let them ring, don't open it, they'll go away."
Amid two unruly wisps on the forehead, that had escaped from her gathered hair, my wife gave me a convincing gaze with a wide smile, flaunting confidence, and whispered, "It's okay, everything according to the plan... I ordered steak for dinner for you, honey... wait here just for a minute, while I pay the delivery girl."
I was speechless.
Violet struggled to her feet.
Her breasts bare, her wrists bound behind her back by two Velcro cuffs, Violet wore only a black silk garter belt to which were attached by laces and two black hold-up stockings with wide bands of elastic lace (the laces were only for adornment, but they were beautiful to look at). The lace delightfully framed her pussy.
On her feet, she laced up thin high-heeled sandals.
Too high heels and too tight wrists made it difficult for her to make any movement, but Violet managed to keep her balance.
Walking slowly on her heels she reached the main door of the house. I could hear her but was out of visual range of a possible "delivery girl". And what if they send us a man!?
I could not believe my eyes.
My wife, naked and cuffed, opened to an unknown delivery girl!
OMG, it had always been a fantasy of mine, but today she was making it come true! My cock had become hard as never before.
I could hear everything from the couch.
I knew how she had managed to open the handle: she had leaned her shoulders against the door and then turned the knob with her hands.
I immediately recognized the chirping voice of the "unknown delivery girl." Eh: it seemed too strange to me that my wife, usually so disinclined to display lingerie, had gone to open the door for a total stranger.
In front of her was her best friend's daughter, Trudy, who had known her for years (and confidentially called her "Auntie Violet" even though we were not legally related). Since she had come of age, Trudy had been delivering from her parents' restaurant.
The girl was holding two cartons for delivery. But, I guessed from her voice that she was paralyzed with astonishment and her eyes and mouth were wide open. "Are you in trouble, Auntie Violet? Do you need me to call 911?"
Without any shame, my wife chuckled: "I was your teacher in the neighborhood self-defense classes at the gym, remember? No problem, my husband and I are celebrating Valentine's Day 20 years late, maybe 22. Everything is okay, just two adults playing in the Valentine's evening. You are a nice girl to worry about, but it is not necessary. Remember my motto, which I used to repeat in self-defense class, "Yes, I'm a damsel, I'm in distress. I can handle this. Have a nice day."
From the couch I heard the girl laughing serenely, repeating in chorus the motto with which my wife always closed her self-defense classes at the gym.
I closed my eyes. How had we gotten to that moment? I closed my eyes and remembered both dates: our first Valentine's Day, and our last.
.
Chapter 2 - two flashbacks: our first Valentine's Day, and our last.
.
Twenty-two years ago, I met my wife. She was an intelligent, rational, energetic, feminist, and full of ideas girl.
We were both college graduates and worked hard. Her mother had had an accident and the doctors had given her a few months to live, so we decided together that we would get married to give that poor dying woman the wedding she had always dreamed of for her daughter.
I was overjoyed that day, also because we also had another surprise for friends and family: at the cake-cutting, my wife announced that we were expecting a baby. I know that such news is usually received in a distorted way, but we had done it as a gift to our dying grandmother. A baby girl was born, a week before Grandma died-she had a chance to hold her just long enough to take the saddest and most beautiful pictures we ever had.
On our first Valentine's Day, my wife was pregnant and throwing up all the time. I brought her a gift (an Eau de parfum) but she threw up and would not even hear about the restaurant I booked in an ill-timed way.
She also said a phrase that I did not understand, "Valentine's Day, the holiday of fools..." But because he was vomiting, maybe I didn't understand him correctly.
The next year she was pregnant again: we had planned it, because our two jobs allowed it and because we thought it would be good for the children to grow up together.
More perfume, more vomit, more of a phrase about the deluded.
Our third Valentine was not pregnant, but she had two small daughters. I ventured to book a restaurant, summon a babysitter, and prepare everything decently, but she denied herself by reciting a nursery rhyme (which was indelibly printed in my mind, in Bookman Old Style 14 bold font):
.
"Valentine's Day is a lie, for each, and every, guy who believes that he is loved; but instead, he will be fooled."
.
My wife has never cheated on me, nor deceived me. Simply, Violet never gave importance to any Calendar party. She didn't even celebrate birthdays or name days; every day in December was the same for her; and the only day she felt truly patriotic was National Day because her father had served in the Navy.
I was always overjoyed with my wife, in all things (love, friendship, complicity, sex, lots of sex). The only thing in which we are not in tune is the Holidays.
I have always been very happy with my wife, in all things (love, friendship, complicity, sex, lots of sex). The only thing in which we are not in tune is the Holidays.
I love all holidays. I catch and exterminate Grinches, I become mayor of Dublin in March after I recite the entirety of "I Have A Dream" at my daughters' school play in February, I have been carving pumpkins since September, I make jam for Thanksgiving, I parade in a Caravel dress on Oct. 12, and I listen to Mariah Carey, The Wham, and Michael Bubl√© starting in November.
I also know all my friends' and relatives' birthdays by heart (even those who wrote January 1, 1900, on social media), and I write something to everyone because I know that a sentence can sometimes be warmer than a scarf.
And, of course, I have continued to buy gifts for her for each of these celebrations. But the absence of reciprocation from her at all other celebrations has never pained me. On my birthday I get a dozen gifts, and I know one is missing, but I don't mind, because friends, siblings, and colleagues make up for the absence.
But Valentine's Day is a holiday for couples in love: and seeing myself rejected every single time, was the thing that made me suffer the most.
I resisted for years. For decades. Once, I bought two perfumes: one for her and one for me. Bad idea. I resisted.
On our 20th wedding anniversary, I looked at my beloved little girls who had become two young women. They raised their goblets to toast the two of us, loving parents and tireless lovers. Seeing two goblets triggered a traumatic memory in me: the crest of the restaurant I had tried to book three times in a row.
My jaw stiffened. The knuckles of my hands turned white. Winston Churchill would have said (or was it Belushi?) "When the going gets tough, the tough get going."
I would not continue. Twenty years of lopsided gift-giving, twenty years of mocking and rhyming against deluded people was too much. My two daughters deserved a better role model than the loser I had been until that day. I swore to myself that I would never again give my wife anything for Valentine's Day. A piece of my heart had become veiled, as if in mourning. Other holidays remained sacred because they were collective events to be experienced together with friends and relatives: but Valentine's Day was over.
We had already spent our last Valentine's Day together, and we hadn't noticed.
#####
On the evening of February 14, my wife came looking for me all hopeful. I was sitting on the couch watching an old Western movie. With a radiant smile, she said to me, "Honey how was your day? Aren't you hungry? Do you want me to make you something to eat?"
I didn't even look at her. It was just an ordinary weekday, like any weekday, she had been teaching me for twenty long years. In an absent tone, I yawned and said, "It's been a tiring day at work... and tomorrow morning I have to wake up earlier... I think I'll go to sleep because, in this old movie, the action is too slow."
Violet looked alarmed. "But aren't you forgetting something, honey?"
"Oh, yes, of course, you're right. I forgot to turn off the lamp light, can you turn it off dear? Thank you."
She was muffled. I was asleep, but she was not there. I don't know what Violet was thinking, in the following days she was very silent.
Coming home after work on March 14, I found a note on the front door.
Chapter 3 the Corrected Valentine's Day Card.
Another memory, much more recent, was a Valentine's Day card that my wife had erased with two strokes of the pen, writing on it "Steak & BJ March, 14th."
Inside was a handwritten message.
"My love, forgive me. All these years I have denied you your legitimate right to enjoy a proper celebration of Valentine's Day. I have forced you to go to fancy restaurants, to see boring vagina monologues in the theater, to hear feminist rallies, to listen to cheesy operas and musicals. And I never reciprocated a gift to you, never made you have sex that night, in the name of a legendary "romance" of that date.
Today I humbly apologize to you. Today I ask you to start a new Family Tradition, with a feast of reparation. In return for all the boring refinements you have had to swallow over the years, I will swallow your cum, which I will earn with two or three sloppy, long blowjobs. Yes, that's right: the very practice that I always said didn't turn me on. Forgive me.
If you accept this Correct Valentine's Day Card of mine, please be at 7 p.m. on the living room couch. I will be your slave until midnight. I swear I will obey your every wish. You may tie me up, whip me, finger my pussy just for the sake of arousing me but without making me enjoy it. You don't have to make me enjoy, you don't have to reciprocate anything: this New Holiday is only for you, you are the only party. At midnight, if you want, you can release me.
Don't worry about making restaurant reservations or fancy clothes, I'll take care of everything. I know some of your desires, although I have always pretended not to notice them, and tonight I will fulfill them as a gift for you.
Signed, your slave in love, as a last free gesture before I close the shackles, Violet. Tuesday, March 14, 2023.

Chapter 4 A woman on the counterattack.
.
It was the evening of Tuesday, March 14, 2023.
As I thought back on those memories, only a fraction of a second had passed. Sitting on the couch, I could still hear my wife talking to the delivery girl, Trudy.
Trudy had not come in: she had stayed outside the main door. It was raining, and everyone knows it hurts to go in and out all the time because of the temperature change. Also, it could be embarrassing to enter the house of an almost naked, handcuffed lady.
Trudy surely had seen my wife naked before, because Violet was part of a feminist gym where girls were taught self-defense: the showers were installed in an open space, and my wife was completely shameless "when there are no drooling maniacal males around" (one of her favorite phrases).
All the girls at the gym jokingly called her "V for Violet" (as if "V for Vendetta"), because she kept the tuft of dark hair above her pussy shaved as if to make up a capital V. Perhaps only I knew the real reason: a few years after the girls' births, the gynecologist told her that it was necessary to remove a fibroid from the uterus, using a laser. Because of the particular location of the fibroid, she made two small incisions, one in the center and one on the right, and over the next few months, we had to shave the hair to spread ointment against keloid formation. Indeed, the V was nice to look at, and even after the scar was completely healed, the two of us kept the habit of shaving the hair to form a V. The color of the hair changed over the years, from auburn red to strawberry blond, but the dark color of the V always remained constant. To me, in particular, it looked like she had not aged a single day, and she did not have a single white hair.
Also, Trudy was the daughter of Violet's best friend, and she was friends with both of our daughters. I guess "the girls," mothers and daughters, went to the pool, saunas, and massages together, not underestimating sessions at the beautician. It is rarer for males to have opportunities to show themselves naked, beyond sports showers (or at least, this is my experience: others will have a different perception, I don't know).
The significant element is that it was not a shock to Trudy to see Auntie Violet naked. The only reason the girl was amazed was to see her wearing sexy lingerie that no one in the gym imagined her wearing (the raging feminist, self-defense teacher). Oh well, perhaps the most surprising element was the handcuffs on her wrists. If I listened carefully, Trudy's questions were not about the stockings, but about the handcuffs.
#####
I tried to listen. I thought, "Live in the present: no more of the past."
Trudy had said "Are you in trouble, Aunt Violet? Do you need me to call 911?"
My wife giggled, "I was your teacher in self-defense classes at the gym, remember? It's no problem, my husband and I are celebrating Valentine's Day 20 years late, maybe 22. It's okay. You are a nice girl to worry about, but it is not necessary. Remember my motto, which I used to repeat in self-defense class, "Yes, I'm a damsel, I'm in distress. I can handle this. Have a nice day."
Trudy joined in the enunciation of the motto: "I can handle this. Have a nice day."
I heard in the girl's voice a note of serenity: she felt relieved.
Trudy chuckled. "Meg from "Hercules": drop some knowledge for us..."
Violet moved a step or two, for I could hear her heels clicking on the hall floor. She had probably turned around to show her handcuffs and reassure Trudy. "You see, they're just plain Velcro handcuffs I wanted to, I could free myself right away. But I'm making a Valentine's Day present..." (I heard the sound of Velcro being ripped off, then closed again).
"But today is March 14!"
"That's right, dear: the National Steak and BJ Day."
"What?"
"Oh, dear, don't pretend to be so Vanilla with me, I'm still your Auntie Violet, I know you well, I know all about your erotic exploits with your boyfriend! To counterbalance Valentine's Day (which often boils down to being just a collection of gifts and attention to women), MEN invented this holiday, and since you know my husband loves all holidays, then I decided that from this year forward we will have a new couple tradition: to celebrate this particular date with him, in the way he likes it best.
It's an effort for me, because you know I hate all holidays including birthdays - except yours, dear - and I hate calendars and anniversaries, like a Grinch, but my husband likes all holidays, as you may have noticed for winter decorations" (sitting on the couch, I hoped my wife wouldn't start one of those boring speeches against the calendar, an invention of the Patriarchy to impose mathematical control over human affairs, while the menstrual cycle corresponds with the phases of the Moon and so on, because Violet could go on for hours. But perhaps, naked in front of the cold rain, my wife would have been shorter than usual. Or maybe, even Trudy didn't feel like being bored once again by her aunt's feminist oratory).
"I know he's manic about Halloween and St. Patrick's Day and all the other holidays... but what's the celebration in this one?" (Trudy's voice was still outside the main door: cold air was coming in. I imagined my wife's nipples erect like two pencils. Why was Violet exposing herself almost naked to all that cold? Just to turn me on. That was the only plausible answer).
"Let's say that Valentine's Day, in its most classic form, involves elegance and sophistication: fancy food suited to elegant female tastes (from a box of chocolates to an entire dinner at a fancy restaurant), cultural occasions to attend in formal dress, and several gifts (to females) and lots of chic conversation, but very little sex.
It is a party designed to satisfy female pretensions-you know, no, females from Venus, men from the planet Mars...
The funny and unique thing is that March 14 is always the same day of the week as compared to February 14: if it was a Saturday or a Tuesday, it repeats the next month identically. This makes it evenly balanced: if in February the couple dedicated a weekday Tuesday, they can (and should) do the same in March.
By contrast, March 14 is named "Steak & Blow-Job" to emphasize that what is at stake is male happiness: which, as everyone knows, settles for primal, instinctive pleasures: a steak, zero conversation, zero fine foods, zero romance, zero orgasms for the woman devoted to giving him a generous blowjob without receiving anything in return-just as my husband never received anything to reciprocate all the gifts he has given me over the years, as well as restaurants, theaters, lectures and other cultural occasions he has had to endure for love of me. "
"That explains your order of two meat dishes."
"Yeah. I had to get ready for the evening, nails, hair removal, and no time to cook."
"But, Auntie Violet, why didn't you pay by card? Or, we could have billed you, you are a person of absolute trustworthiness..."
"Ah, right! You are kind, Trudy dear, but it's part of my role--if you don't mind--now that I think of it! If it bothers you to see me handcuffed, feel free to tell me..."
"No, Aunt Violet, it is heartwarming to see a couple still loving after so many years. Most couples I know either fight or divorce."
"Maybe the secret is just carving out moments for quality sex. I don't know. I've made so many mistakes over the years, but today I feel like I can make up for it.
Let's focus: now I need you to hold my ground.
Now you will tell me how much I spend.
I will answer that I have to go and get the money in the living room, in front of the couch.
And you will please answer that you will wait for me here, okay?
I'll go to the living room and get the money and then come back here through the main door."
I don't know why, but I guess at this point Violet winked at Trudy.
The girl had no reason to doubt her mother's best friend, and she was not even asked to come in (which would have been very suspicious), and she simply replied, "Okay, I'll wait here."
"No, you have to ask me for a sum, dear."
"Ah! I'm not a skilled actress like Emma Thompson, huh (giggled). Let's start rehearsing again."
In a louder voice, to be heard well, Trudy resumed, "Here's your order, Ms. Violet. It's 21.95 in total."
"Oh, just a moment, kind unknown girl, I'll go get the cash in the living room right away!" replied Violet, also in a loud voice. I had already heard it all, but listening to the two women as they planned an act for my benefit made me very excited.
"I'll wait for you outside the main door here, ma'am!"
I heard my wife's heels clicking rapidly on the floor.
She positioned herself in front of me, standing with her legs spread wide apart. Her nipples were stiff with cold. The pussy, indicated by the dark capital V that I had shaved so many times, trembled.
She squatted on top of me. Her cold pussy rubbed against my hot cock. Her nipples, like two ice cubes, against my warm chest.
She brought her mouth close to my ear.
Her voice trembled with excitement. She was whispering, not to be heard by Trudy, even though the main door was closed, I could tell by the rising temperature of the room.
"Happy March 14, my love. You are free to choose whatever you want, this day is for you, from this year forever.
If you want to stop, let's stop. I will put on cotton pajamas and go to sleep like a frustrated housewife.
If you want me to serve your steak, I need $25. Right now. I have to pay a delivery girl who's waiting outside the door, and I don't have any pockets right now, as you can see, go ahead and check if you want -- search me. Shake me down.
Your call. If you want to lend me $25, on trust, counting on me being able to pay you back tonight, then please put the bills in my hand, because I'm handcuffed.
If all these years my behavior during the holidays, and especially my silly nursery rhymes, have hurt you... if you think it's fairer for me to painstakingly earn my $25... if you order me to do so, I will kneel now and make you cum with a blowjob, and then I will go answer the door with my face and hair covered in your cum."
Before continuing, Violet let out a sigh.
"If you would now order me to get you an available girl for next year...sigh..., I swear I will obey you and give you the services of a girl who will allow you to eat both her steak and her pussy: but don't ask me to invite in my best friend's daughter, just today, that would not be fair.
You choose the characteristics of this New Tradition of ours. I am aware that I have always boycotted you all the Valentine's Days of the past years, and I would like you to give me this opportunity to redeem myself, before the Ebenezer Scrooge of the Past Years comes, with chains and shackles, to wake me up at night."
I said nothing. Leaving her for a moment in doubt that I might choose the worst option for her gave me untold pleasure. I had always done everything I could to make parties great for others, and today for the first time my wife was providing me with an opportunity to create a new tradition.
I whispered to her, "Close your eyes."
I grabbed my pants and she heard the sound of the fabric rubbing against the skin of the couch. She could not know what I was doing: perhaps I was masturbating to facilitate the cumshot with which I would paint her face.
After a moment (which seemed to her to last a century) I slipped three ten-dollar bills between the fingers of her right hand. I had also slipped the belt off the loops.
I told her to open her eyes: she thought for a moment that I would whip her, and that I would send her to the main door exposing a red bruise on her buttocks.
I slid my belt above her elbows, squeezing them tightly, and then buckled her. Her breasts jutted forward because the new restraints forced her shoulders into an unnatural position. Perhaps Violet was in a little pain, but she decided to resist to please me... as I had resisted dozens of feminist meetings and dozens of boring theatrical monologues.
I nibbled weakly on one of her nipples, eliciting a moan of pleasure from her.
"Run and pay Trudy. Leave her a tip. Tell her to leave the boxes in the cabinet. Thank her for her patience and leave the tip. Get right back here."
I closed my eyes, to focus on the melodious sound of her heels running to pay for the delivery.
I listened to short sentences from the two female voices, a double kiss on both cheeks and a couple of joyful greetings. Finally, the girl left, yelling from afar, "Good Luck, Auntie!"
I heard the sound of the main door closing: perhaps the girl had closed it on her way out, or perhaps Violet had pushed it shut with her back.
Here again, was the delicious sound of her heels. Violet was gorgeous: her tits were taut and her nipples erect, both from the excitement of being seen by another person and from the tension caused by the belt tightened above her elbows.
She walked slowly, to give me time to get a good look at her. I will never forget that magnificent gait, majestic and humble, fit for a queen but also a slave: for a queen who had agreed to be my slave for a day.
Violet's lips were half-open. Yes, lips: the two labia that encircled the clitoris. Violet also smiled at me with her delicious mouth: the lips, the other ones, the top ones. Very calmly, she placed her right foot on the coffee table, allowing me to closely contemplate her beautiful pussy.
She wore black lace-up shoes covering only her toes. Tiny laces showed her beautiful ankle in stockings. I didn't remember her ever buying those shoes: they were very elegant, perhaps she had worn them to a friend's wedding. I had given her the stockings but she had never worn them. The thought that Violet had prepared this whole show for me made my heart melt like snow under the sun.
Then, slowly, Violet rested her right knee on the couch, and gently slid into the same position as before, with her knees wide open, her pussy rubbed against my cock, and her tits stretched forward by her elbows tightened by the belt.
With voice matter of fact, I established some corrections to the proposal she had made, both in the note and in the options just enunciated.
"Here are the rules of the New Tradition. Every March 14, or any immediately available date in case of a natural disaster, the two of us will celebrate Steak & BJ.
The celebration will begin at 7 p.m.
You, the wife, are to be decked out in this way at all times, or in other even skimpier lingerie. And you will be handcuffed at all times, at the very least with these Velcro manacles, or with other, more constrictive handcuffs, such as a gibbet or a belt that holds your forearms and neck in place. And heels. Nothing to impede my free access to nipples or pussy.
No conversation. Elegant conversation is a conventional Valentine's Day ritual. Here we are in the cave of the Primitive Man, I don't want to hear talk, I want only moans, grunts, and monosyllables.
I, the husband, will watch television. But not porn, or anything exciting. Your punishment, for denying me twenty years of valentines, will be to blow job me all evening while I watch a sports channel. And as you have never reciprocated me at parties, I will do with you: you will have no orgasm until midnight on March 15.
You wrote that I have had to swallow several boring things over the years. You will have to swallow at least two cumshots or even three. With handcuffs, you will not be able to eat freely: you will have to beg me to feed you, like a small child. And also drink. By the way: soda, light alcohol, but most importantly, free burp.
If next year any of your friends would like to participate -- if Trudy, or any of the girls in the class where you teach self-defense or any of your friends, would like to participate, for free and without payment, we'll see.
I have never paid a woman for sex and I do not intend to do so now. But I have paid cooks, butlers, and violinists to make Valentine's Day evening unforgettable for you. To no avail. Maybe next year you could recruit an assistant, or a violinist, or a cook -- we'll see.
That's all for now. But it's a tradition about to be started, and we may add new rules in the future. If you disagree, say the Safeword we usually use with handcuffs ["tiger cubs"], and I will release you and you will go to sleep like a frustrated housewife, but without swallowing anything. Take your time to make up your mind. If you agree to the rules, then, without speaking, kneel and suck me, that before eating I want to cum in your throat."
Violet kissed me, a long, sloppy kiss, twirling her tongue like a horny teenager. Then without taking her mouth off my skin, she went down with her tongue to my neck, my chest, sliding her pussy down my thigh. She began a slow, sloppy-blowjob, spending a lot of time on my balls and the frenulum under the chapel. Then she made my cock plunge into her throat like a pool welcomes a darting dolphin.
I was about to stop her, but then I thought that a real primitive man would show no kindness.
I didn't have to warn her. I didn't even have to help her. I cum suddenly, almost choking her with the jet. Violet struggled to swallow as much as she could but some of the cum fell on her chin and tits.
If we had been in a fancy club, I would have wiped her chin with a silk napkin. But we were in a prehistoric cave, and I decided I would not wipe her at all. Still a New Tradition of March 14th.
She just said, "TV?"
Monosyllables were accepted.
"Advice?" asked I, still distracted by the cumshot.
Violet's response surprised me: "The Best!"
Oh, wow! So my wife listens to me when I talk to friends! And all these years she's been pretending she didn't know, and dragging me to see "The Phantom of The Opera" and "Hamilton," while she knew full well what "The Best" was!"
With her eyes, she pointed to the remote control. My favorite soccer game was already in the DVD player: the 2005 Soccer Champions League final. So many years have passed, and I don't think it's a spoiler: it was the most famous comeback in sports history. The problem is it's almost two hours long! And my wife couldn't stand that I spent so much time watching a sport!
An Italian team, Milan, was leading by three goals at the end of the first half. All seemed lost: three goals, in soccer, seemed insurmountable, and Milan was famous for having the most compact defense in the world.
But in the second half, the players of the English team (Liverpool) came onto the field with their eyes ablaze with a decision: "We don't give up, it's not over, it's not too late, we can still turn the tables." The captain, Gerrard, scored the first goal. A defender scored the second goal. The Italians panicked. They blundered, they made mistakes. The equalizing goal came. And in the end, the English won.
This match always aroused great emotions in me. It showed that despite the mistakes in the first phase, we always have time to make up for them. My wife had remembered that I liked to watch that game, but perhaps she was not fully aware of the metaphorical meaning: 20 years of failed valentines could be compensated with 20 years of glorious March 14th.
"90?" she asked.
"A normal game lasts 90 minutes. But here we have extra time and penalties. It's at least two hours, even longer. If you need to pee you can ask me."
"No... Thanks... Sir."
Without further words, he continued to lick my cock, which was becoming flaccid, to clean every drop of cum. She did not take off her heels, did not ask for the liberation of her elbows, and continued to lick my balls and shaft for the entire First half of 45 minutes.
I decided it was time for meat. I got up and went to get the two cardboard boxes. It was still hot, but not boiling: perfect. It wasn't a real steak (the restaurant's policy advised against taking steaks home) but it was two gorgeous burgers.
Mine was truly primal. Two huge portions of meat separated by onion, chili, and bacon: my wife was not afraid my breath would get worse, or she was willing to suffer that too to make me happy.
Hers was slightly more feminine, but still prehistoric: a portion of baby meat, with cheese and pistachio seeds. I noticed that her burger had arrived already and cut into small bites.
"What?"
"Meow!" she meowed, with a smile.
What a fool I am. Among the fantasies I had often confessed to her during pillow talks after orgasm, one was that she would open the door naked to a delivery boy at a pizza stand. But another, was for her, handcuffed, to eat her dinner from the bowl, without hands or forks. I had almost forgotten; she had remembered.
She meowed, like a kitten, to draw my attention to the drawer of the coffee table. I opened it. Inside was a striped, furry tail that I had bought many years ago and had never wanted to wear. It was connected with a metal anal plug. There was also a gel packet but a post-it note read "don't need it" written in her soft handwriting.
While I admired the contents of the drawer, she was crouched on her thighs, crouched. Her fully shaven rosebud was exposed to the air, and she was begging me to stick the plug of her tail into her so she could begin to eat from the bowl.
I stuck a fingertip in to feel if she was hot. She was hot. I stroked the groove between her labia: it was wet and hot. My wife had never been a submissive woman, but all that preparation had turned her on.
I decided to use a little bit of lubricant, without telling her: she must have continued to think I had been prim and unkind. I pushed it in slowly: she groaned and wiggled her fingers, but she did not ask to stop me (and never uttered her Safeword).
I opened the carton with her chopped hamburger and allowed her to feed by bending her back: my belt locked her elbows, so her nipples rubbed bare against the rough lace of her hold-up stockings, and I could see that they were erect.
With each mouthful, she inflicted torture on herself with her nipples, rubbing them against the lace of her stockings. My mind was aroused; the cock was still flaccid from normal dormancy times. She knew this but continued to suffer, to arouse my most repressed instincts.
As I watched my wife suffer on her knees for me, I made the second half begin on TV and began to eat my double burger using both hands. Unlike her, that night I was free, serene, and with no obstacle between me and pleasure.
At the first English goal, she heard me exult, so she got up from the bowl and crawled toward me walking on her knees. She had not wiped her chin, which was now smeared with cum and pistachio sauce.
All she said was, "BJ?"
"Allowed."
And she began to lick a limp cock, from a man who was thinking of something else entirely. Liverpool was coming back one step after another, and my cock was also regaining energy, one lick after another. After the goal of the temporary equalizer, I had a remarkable erection, grabbed my wife's skull, and fucked her mouth without any respect.
She let me do it. In the only moment of pause I gave her, she said only, "Cum in!"
I didn't let her tell me twice. I cummed in her throat angrily, with all the nervousness I had accumulated all these years. I had finally achieved peace.
I resumed watching the game, not at all bothering to reciprocate, make conversation, or even clean her up. She was slumped on one buttock, her head resting on the sofa. I wondered why she was not sitting normally, then I remembered that she had the tail plug in her ass. It was an item she used so rarely, that I had forgotten about it.
Violet was fatigued, but it did not diminish her enthusiasm. After swallowing all the cum in her mouth, she licked her lips, then began to lick my shaft and balls to clean me well.
She devoted a lot of time to licking my knob. It almost looked as if she cherishes polishing it as if she were polishing a brass knob to make it shine in the middle of the living room.
She noticed that a large drop of semen had fallen on my right tit. So she rubbed it against my cock and then with her tongue scooped up whatever she could, trying to maintain eye contact as much as possible, even though I flaunted disinterest, often distracting myself by watching TV. It was humiliating but also exciting, certainly for me, but I think also for her. After the first big drop, she sought to repeat the same gesture and humiliate herself even more, just to turn me on.
I don't remember Violet ever devoting so much time with her mouth to my cock: normally she used her hands, or even her feet, her tits, and especially her pussy, but today she was extremely focused on oral attention. I felt that a wonderful Tradition was being born that we would repeat in future years.
After the end of the second half of the soccer game, there was still half an hour of overtime left. I ordered her to get up, "Get up, I need your service, unless you are too tired."
"Ready."
With much effort, propping herself up against the couch with her elbows tied, Violet stood up on her heels. She stood in front of me, her thighs slightly open and her chin covered with sauce and cum.
"Yes."
"First, I want to see you walk to the kitchen. I want to see waving your dangling tail: you will have to sway your hips a lot as you walk. For the elegance of your gait, I recommend that you always put one foot exactly in front of the other.
In the kitchen, you can open the sink faucet with your mouth, and rinse your chin. I will join you later -- I will walk behind you, to enjoy the view."
She walked very slowly, shaking her ass and swaying on her heels. Her tiger tail swayed left and right. I let her humble herself by wetting her face in the faucet, and then I turned off the water and dried her off.
From the freezer, I took some ice cubes and a soda. I didn't want the alcohol to ruin the memories of that evening. I handed her the glass and allowed her to take a few sips, although some of the liquid fell on her nipples, causing them to swell from the cold.
She gave a little burp and smiled at me. She did it on purpose to encourage me. One more New Tradition. I took a long swig of soda and then let out a loud belch, which in a prehistoric village would have gotten me elected chieftain. In a fancy club, it would have been embarrassing; in our cave, it was a sign of intimacy and complicity.
There were ice cubes left.
Violet looked at me hopefully and said, "Ice?"
"Yes, dear, Ice. You already have a toy in your rosebud, but you are missing something in your pussy, which I know is at my complete disposal."
"Purr..." she hummed like a cat in heat.
I took an ice cube and ran it over her nipples.
She gasped.
Then, unceremoniously, I slipped a cube inside her pussy and pushed it in with my finger. Before she could react, I took another one and slipped it in. The first one was already melting rapidly.
"Walk to the living room. Go fast on your heels if you don't want to drip all over the hall. I still have to see the extras, and if I had a loving and affectionate wife, maybe she could give me a third blowjob again."
My wife opened her eyes wide in amazement. Three ejaculations within two hours would have been quite abnormal for me. More importantly, that way she would have dried me dry, reducing to zero the chances that I could fuck her at midnight. But she had promised to obey, and she obeyed, even if it meant giving up her orgasm to give a third to me.
Sitting on the couch, I watched the game. My wife was straining to make me cum with her mouth, as her pussy contracted from the effect of the melting ice, and the anal plug kept urging from behind.
But after two cumshots, my cock was flaccid and reacting very little. My wife understood that it was just a selfish whim on my part: I was not aroused and had already had two orgasms, and indirectly I was asking her to give up her own. On a normal day, my selfish behavior would have triggered an argument full of words, but on the Traditional B & J Holiday, we had agreed that she would utter nothing but monosyllables.
Violet could have resorted to Safeword, but she decided to continue, even though she understood it was a futile effort.
Violet continued relentlessly, never asking for a respite. Even after the game was over, she continued licking and sucking. She continued again and again, desperately, moaning, panting, because she wanted at all costs to fulfill my order even though it was an almost impossible order.
Seeing all her efforts affected me. Her forehead, beaded with sweat, her wet locks of hair, her mouth, exhausted from the effort, her tongue, which for once had not been used to give a thousand lectures on rights and injustices. And her magnificent tits, with her nipples, pushed forward by the strap with which I had gripped her elbows.
She deserved me to help her. And I wanted to help her. Her goal was to swallow more cum, I focused on all the wonderful things she had done for me on March 14th, and I cum.
It wasn't a flood, it wasn't a hurricane: it was an honest stream of cum. After three blowjobs she had dried me dry, completely.
I released her elbows, leaving only the Velcro cuffs (if she had wanted, she could have taken them off. To my amazement, she did not).
I removed her anal plug. I wiped off all the water that had melted from her two ice cubes.
She was exhausted, like a child who had played too much and needed to sleep. I picked her up and carried her to her room, then gently laid her in bed. It was 15 minutes to midnight.
She whispered to me, "Love."
"I love you too, honey. It was the 14th, non-Valentine's, best day ever. Now get some rest."
Violet pouted with sweet eyes. "Love..."
"No, darling, after three cumshots I couldn't get laid if Wonder Woman herself was in the bed, tied with the golden rope of Truth."
Violet couldn't contain herself: she was itching to have an orgasm herself!
But she had enough willpower to avoid uttering whole sentences. She said only, "Pussy..."
"For fifteen minutes more, you can't have orgasms. You know, it's a long family tradition, March 14th until midnight. But I promise, after midnight I'll eat it for you."
And, you can believe me. She was horny as hell from the anticipation, and I was super eager at eating it and fingering her (double: I knew full well that she loved it when the two fingers in the pink rubbed flesh against the other finger buried in the rosebud).
From the way she wiggled and moaned, I think I can tell she had a very intense orgasm. We both fell asleep happily -- a seemingly simple fact, but one that had rarely happened on February 14th.

Chapter 5 The next morning, coffee, and a silly nursery rhyme.
.
The next morning we both woke up very tired. I had had three orgasms and one, but perhaps we could have both increased the count that morning (December 26 also has its traditions).
Violet stroked my hair and sang. If you have never heard a woman sing in the morning after having an orgasm, you cannot understand the joy of it. Universal literature agrees that there is no more beautiful sight for the eyes than to see a woman as she orgasms: but personally, I would like to add, that there is no sweeter sound for the ears than to hear a woman singing in the morning after having had a night of orgasms.
I asked her if I had hurt her or if she had felt humiliated. She giggled and laughingly confessed to me that it had been the most exciting night of her life. She kissed me and got up to make coffee. It was not a gesture of submission but a true need: we both needed a cup to wake up.
Still half-asleep, I was mulling over a new nursery rhyme, suitable for the New Tradition: to replace and if possible eliminate from memory that old and hateful nursery rhyme.
I was still unconscious and may not have composed a masterpiece in the strict sense, but let us say it was a kind of first draft. In my mind, it was composed in Bookman Old Style font, 14, bold, like in a school book. And some words were in underlined italics, like "beloved" and "cuffed."
.
First stanza
March 14th is the day when every beloved guy Will receive so many blowjobs as long as he kindly stops his gorgeous cuffed wife. Eating steak with a fork and knife,
he watches soccer, basketball, or football. While the pussycat feeds from the bowl,
there are no napkins to wipe her chin: traditional rule of March 14th!
.
Second stanza
There are no boring theaters or clubs or restaurants Nor annoying shoes, strict ties, or fancy pants. Ties, perhaps, might be near the couch (with her labia open, waiting for your touch) but not of the kind you wore at your work desk: maybe earlier she was wearing a costume for burlesque but now she shows herself almost naked and exposed to you, or the delivery girl near the main door unclosed. The wife will be granted a Safeword to ease (with whatever motivation) of a quick and kind release.
.
Third stanza
From seven o'clock p.m. to midnight her heels will be a gift for the sight And she will satisfy his cock with her tongue (no fancy conversation!) all evening long. He has no obligation to reciprocate her, he just has to be relaxed, and cum on the hair.
And if you are (as you are) deep in love, you will make her cum too, after half a night but, first, cuffed both under and above, she cherishes polishing your knob, shiny and bright.
.
Fourth stanza
March 14th is the day when each and every beloved guy gets refunds from Valentine's delusions By his faithful wife and her sweet effusions. Once, she believed it was just a fairytale; today, she sways her hips, waving her feline tail,
walking her gait, cuffed, on her high heels she comes back to your cock; now she kneels. Eager she licks your balls, still asking cum from you: by now, she'll never call you (again) a fool.

Chapter 6 - Conclusion (a coffee and a message).
.
Violet had gotten up to make coffee in the kitchen. After a few minutes, she returned with the tray, cups, creamer, and her cell phone on. I hadn't noticed, but she had kept it off so as not to be disturbed by yesterday.
"Look, love, a message from young Trudy!"
She showed me her phone. The message read:
"Help me, Auntie Violet: you're my only Hope! Last week my boyfriend dumped me because he says I'm boring, predictable, and too "vanilla"! I am in love with him, I would do anything to make him happy, how can I do it? Can you please help me? I now realize that you are an expert in many things, not just self-defense... I beg you..."
I said, "With great power comes great responsibility, my love.
It seems that the citizenry of the neighborhood needs the help of the superheroine "V for Violet" a self-defense former teacher.
You need to teach a new course of study for girls like Trudy: "How To Set Up A Perfect S&BJ Date"...
...but that's another tale.
