"I know you don't really want an engagement party but my university friends probably won't come to our wedding and were keen to do something." Becky said to me trying to convince me an evening out with a bunch of people I barely knew would be enjoyable.
- "Yeah I know and it's ok. It should be fun."
"Good, and yeah it should be. I could make it a lot more fun for you, you know?" She teased.
- "How would you do that?"
"Is there anything you would like me to wear?"
- "What's wrong with what you are wearing?" I asked as she'd just spent ages doing her hair, make-up and had a nice dress on.
"No, no you don't understand. Is there anything you would really like me to wear tonight?...Or perhaps not wear..." Becky asked, biting her lower lip and giving a lustful look.
- "Well... I'd like it if you wore your new coat..."
"I can do that."
- "I mean just your coat, nothing else...at all" I stated, clarifying my thoughts.
"Yeah, I can do that." Becky reaffirmed, she knew exactly what I meant and clearly liked the idea.
She disappeared into the bathroom with her new bright blue trench coat under her arm. I lay down on her bed with my heart racing, we were about to go out to our own engagement party with who knows how many of her university friends at a bar that was unknown to me and she would dressed in nothing but a short rain coat.
I couldn't believe it, occasionally Becky was in the mood to show off her body and do wild things but not that often and anything we had done so far had just been the two of us not a huge group of her friends. The door creaked open, I had my phone out to capture this on video as I didn't want to miss it. She stood with her arms crossed, the short trench coat showed off her long legs in a way I'd not seen before. She grinned and laughed as she spoke.
"It's not as warm as you'd think..."
- "Not as warm? What's not as warm?"
"The coat."
- "Well that might also be to do with what else you are wearing?" I teased as she walked slowly toward me.
"But I'm not wearing anything else underneath...nothing at all."
- "Well that's very naughty. I love it!" I beamed.
"I know! Shall we go?"
- "Yes, just before we do... open your coat and show me..."
"And ruin the anticipation?... I'll give you a glimpse..." She replied while undoing the belt of the coat that was holding it closed.
Becky held the material so it didn't show much but I could see a definitive line of skin which went all the way from her face down to her exposed legs. There was clearly nothing underneath and I made some approving noises as she re tied her jacket. She put on some nice black heeled shoes that had black laces that tie together halfway up her calf.
I still couldn't believe she was going to do this, she had changed a lot in her time at university. Through the confidence I helped give her in her own body doubled with her new found popularity she had turned from such a shy girl who thought she had an unremarkable body into a little minx who loved to show off on occasion. She was rarely keen to show any skin in public but from time to time she'd want to wear something sexy. She had also grown to love the attention a lot of boys at university gave her and would be getting more attention than normal tonight now we were engaged all eyes were on her - so she was out wearing just a coat!
As soon as we left her small flat she expressed dislike of the low temperature but made no sign of concern at what she was wearing, this in a way was even more a turn on -- it was like she did it all the time or nothing unusual was happening. My heart was pounding harder and harder the more people we passed while we walked but Becky just seemed to smile more and more taking it all in clearly enjoying the whole experience. As we got to the bar a few people were waiting for us and welcomed us, a few guys offered to get us drinks and take our coats which made Becky and I look at each other and smile.
"LEGS!! - Becky! I've never seen your legs on show like they are tonight! Are you even wearing anything under there? Must be a very short skirt!" Becky's friend Rachel joked.
- "Oh it's tiny, there's nothing there!" Becky replied laughing, glancing at me with a wink.
"I know what you mean I've a few like that, not brave enough to wear them out anymore though!" Rachel continued. "Always scared someone will see my underwear!"
- "Yeah, I don't think anyone will see mine tonight!" Becky continued to joke bravely, Rachel unaware of the truth of all she was saying.
"Because you aren't wearing any!" Rachel laughed clearly thinking her statement was absurd.
- "Something like that!"
"Ooh I'm intrigued!" Rachel grinned. Becky smiled at her and then started talking to other people who were arriving.
As the evening wore on the alcohol was affecting everyone more and more. Becky had always been a bit of a flirt and clearly when I was not around during the week some of the guys grew a little too fond of this and perhaps a little too fond of her. When I was around at the weekends things always seemed a little awkward as they didn't know what to make of me.
"Aren't you hot in that coat Becky?" her friend Jon asked. "You sure I can't take it for you?"
- "It's all she's wearing." I blurted out. Becky looked stunned and horrified at my announcement to those nearby.
"What? Really? Yeah whatever..." Jon replied assuming I couldn't be serious. "Though I've never seen your legs properly Becky, didn't think you had any skirts?" He asked poking fun of her more usual way of dressing.
Becky looked stunned and kept quiet, she started to go red and stood crossing her arms and legs looking away from everyone. Jon looked a little closer at her as she stood.
"I think you might just be serious..." Jon hesitantly stated while looking at me. I raised my eyebrows and gave the impression I wasn't sure.
- "What's this?" Their friend Andrew asked as he overheard a snippet of conversation.
"I don't think Becky's wearing anything underneath her coat!"
- "Yeah right! -- You wish!" Andrew rebuked.
"No I'm serious! Ben said it was all she's wearing and Becky hasn't said a word since and is now looking very uncomfortable, plus look at her can you see anything but her coat?!" Jon explained. Becky looked at them both and shrugged.
- "No I don't believe it. Becky open your coat." Andrew requested reaching out his arms to grab the buckle on the belt holding her coat together.
"No, no, NO -- NO -- STOP! I'M SERIOUS STOP!" Becky screamed with more panic in each word as Jon and Andrew tried to hold her down and open her jacket. My heart raced as I stood motionless, horrified yet incredibly turned on by what was happening.
At this point almost everyone else had also stopped what they were doing and were now looking at Becky, Jon and Andrew. A few others nearby started to whisper and joke amongst themselves about it all.
"Becky has an announcement to make!" Andrew stated loudly still with a grasp on her coat, Becky's hands were on top of his in a desperate effort to stop him pulling the buckle holding her jacket closed. "Becky if you don't tell them I'm going to show them!" He then threatened.
Becky was pushing desperately against Jon who was holding her by the shoulders to stop her running off. A group of her guy friends all stood around like vultures waiting for something to happen and I remained stunned, fully focused on Andrew's hand and his grip on Becky's belt buckle.
"Thank you all for coming!" Becky called out with panic in her voice. "No, please don't!" She then whispered to Andrew directly. Everyone cheered at the first of her statements.
- "Hey. Let go." I said firmly in Andrew's ear as I stepped in. He obeyed and raised his hands like I'd put a gun to his back. "It's true, now let it go and leave her alone." I demanded. He wouldn't try anything now as he knew I was serious. Becky gasped as she straightened her jacket out and regained some composure, she then hugged me in thanks.
As the evening wore on Andrew and Jon continued to be fascinated by Becky's outfit. They stood drinking in a corner regularly pointing at her and gesturing a lot with their hands. After Becky had made the rounds and talked with many of her friends she came and stood next to me, I put my arm around her shoulder and we walked over to Jon and Andrew who gestured we go outside with them. It was quite a lot colder outside, Becky shivered and rubbed her arms while keeping them crossed, her long exposed legs soon getting goose bumps as she stood bouncing from foot to foot.
"Cold?" Andrew asked Becky directly.
- "What do you think?" she snapped.
"So...." Jon awkwardly said, looking up with his hands in his pockets.
- "So..." Becky replied in a similar fashion.
"So.. you really are naked under your coat! We think..." Andrew began to speak.
- "What do you think?" I asked dubiously.
"...We think you should prove it."
- "Why would I do that?" Becky asked in outrage.
"Well if you don't, we will tell everyone! -- You don't have to open your coat fully, just show us enough to know there's nothing else under there."
- "Well... I don't think anyone would believe you but I tell you what... I'll give you this. It should keep you going a while." Becky confidently teased while she noticed the boys both flip their phones to camera mode.
She pulled her coat apart slightly at the opening near her neck, pulling it down and apart enough to see a lot of chest, she moved her hands down revealing more and more cleavage and the gap between her breasts, you could see the edges of her perky boobs and nothing else where a bra would normally be. The guys stood with their mouths wide open in a stunned silence.
"Kinky." Becky boldly proclaimed.
- "Hell yes!" the boys shouted. "We still don't believe you aren't wearing something else under there though!" Andrew then added.
"Tough that's all you're getting!" Becky retorted.
- "But we will tell everyone!..." Jon pleaded in desperation.
"Well if you don't really believe it why would everyone else? You clearly do believe it, you just want to see more."
- "What are you all doing out here?" Rachel asked as she stepped outside to join us, breaking up some of the tension. "Becky you must be glad you kept your coat on its pretty cold out here!" She continued as the rest of us exchanged awkward looks.
"Yeah very glad!" Becky answered. "I'd be very cold without it!" She added sticking her tongue out at the boys playfully.
- "You're not even wearing tights your legs must be freezing! And the draft going right up your skirt!" Rachel innocently stated.
"Yeah its very windy! I feel like I may as well be naked under this coat!"
- "What exactly are you wearing? I can't even see anything under your jacket." She leaned in closer to Becky and myself so the guys couldn't hear "And if you aren't wearing a bra I bet you're poking out more than normal!"
"Yeah that is an issue!" Becky replied loudly so all could hear. "Let's go back inside." She requested.
- "Some of us are thinking of going to a club shortly, you want to come along? Obviously it's your party but you might have other things you'd rather be doing after. Still it'd be a shame to waste your outfit and not show it off, sounds a bit risqué for this bar we're in now?"
"It's about as revealing as an outfit could be!" Becky declared with Andrew and Jon smirking as they lingered in the background.
- "Oh well then you definitely have to show it off before you get hitched! I'm sure Ben won't mind?" Rachel continued, turning to me for approval.
"Yes they definitely need to come to the club and show off what Becky is wearing under the coat!" Andrew loudly added.
- "Have you seen it?" Rachel turned and asked.
"She showed us a glimpse, very hot, very revealing! We couldn't see anything but skin!" Jon enthused.
- "Aw you naughty girl I don't think I've seen this side of you, I like it! Sounds like you are practically naked under there!" Rachel beamed happily.
A group of those from our party soon headed off to a club that wasn't too far to walk from where we were. As we walked most people talked of things going on at university and how much work they had to do while grumbling they had lectures at 9am Monday which meant they couldn't be out as late as they wanted to be.
But quite a few people continued to be fascinated by Becky's attire and I could hear murmurs among them saying they thought she could be naked under her coat, most seemed to dismiss this idea quickly as it wasn't like her at all but they did all seem to agree she had great legs and should show them off more. It was a hot topic and Rachel seemed very keen to see her sexy outfit and just how revealing it was, Becky however was looking more and more worried as we got closer to the club. Once we arrived she looked terrified. After waiting in line for some time the doormen let us through and we stood inside paying to enter, some of us leaving coats in the cloakroom behind the main desk.
"Come on Becky we're all dying to see what you're wearing!" Rachel enthused. Becky looked at me wide eyed and concerned.
- "Becky won't be taking her coat off." I stated so everyone could hear, struggling to raise my voice above the bass thudding from the main hall next door.
"Because she's not wearing anything else!" Andrew shouted loudly. Everyone looked at him in disbelief and then turned to Becky expectantly.
- "Is that true Becky?" Rachel asked directly sounding rather exited by the idea.
"Well not exactly..." Becky bashfully answered. She smiled, looking away and going red in the face. The tension among her friends was palpable. "I mean... I'm also wearing these shoes..." She added bursting into laughter. An audible gasp came from the guys around us.
- "No way!" Rachel screamed. "That's so hot! -- Are you serious?"
"Yes." Becky confirmed, nodding in what appeared to be relief that the truth was out.
- "So just to clarify, you are wearing nothing but a coat and your shoes?" A voice called out that I didn't know.
"Nothing else."
- "No underwear?" Another voice shouted.
"Nope!" Becky answered now smiling ear to ear and looking rather flushed.
Her friends couldn't believe it, they all wanted to ask her about it and now it was out in the open there was a huge added buzz in the air. It was now always going to be known as the evening Becky went out wearing just a coat rather than being our engagement party. People thought it was brave and sexy but most of all they couldn't believe she had done it at all because she just wasn't known for dressing sexy.
We all found some seats in the corner of the club near the bar and sat on some leather sofas where those of us left could talk. Becky had difficulty keeping her modesty covered as she sat because if she sat forward and crossed her legs the top of her coat gaped open and with people now being extra vigilant trying to look down her top that wasn't an option, however if she sat back she then couldn't cross her legs which was also essential. She ended up sat forward and just had to make extra effort to keep her arms over her coat and keep it closed.
People wanted to know if it was the first time Becky had done anything like this and she began to speak of the time we went for a picnic and she spilled juice on her top, she then looked around to see how many people were there and despite being rather a crowded park took off her tank top revealing her bra briefly to the public before putting her zip up hoody back on. The story didn't seem as exciting as tonight until she explained she then saw juice on her bra too so unhooked it and took that off too before leaving the zip of her hoody undone at the front. I remember well as she lay down on the blanket with her tummy on show and her breasts almost fully exposed except for her nipples.
"What will you be doing next?" One of her friends asked curiously.
- "I don't know, I don't plan these things far in advance!" Becky replied looking a little embarrassed.
"Well is there anything you've thought of doing and haven't yet? You're a gorgeous girl you can get away with this kind of stuff!"
- "Well... I'm not so sure about that, but... I've a few ideas... But I don't want to be getting a reputation as some kind of whore!"
"Well... you'll have a reputation now, not a whore though as you're loyal to one man! Plus it's not like anyone can see anything!" Rachel said enthusiastically trying to encourage Becky to continue.
- "Yeah I mean no one knows if the carpet matches the drapes yet." Andrew smirked. Someone asked what that meant. "It means... you know, does her hair below match the hair on her head!" A few girls punched him playfully as he giggled.
"Oh what! Andy I can't believe you. You're obsessed!" Becky squealed at him.
- "Well if the colours don't match then where's the commitment? It's good to know these kinds of things... Plus is it a light trim, landing strip, thumb print, nothing at all..." He continued, clearly quite drunk.
"Why is that good to know?!" Another girl asked him quite angrily.
- "Because it's nice to have an idea of how kinky a woman is and you can kind of tell by how well they groom down below."
"Oh shut up Andy!" The girls shouted together in disgust. He was still adamant he had a point, I just laughed.
Becky, Rachel and a few of the girls decided to get up and go for a dance on the dance floor. I stayed with most the guys on the sofas, they were still stunned and kept asking me more about Becky while constantly looking over to the dance floor to see what the girls were doing. A few headed over to join them and they all seemed to form a circle around Becky as she raised her arms in the air and danced. A few people around the club seemed to take an interest in our group and there was lots of talking in peoples ears and pointing at Becky -- Strangers would then pull a surprised face and stare more intently at Becky who seemed to enjoy the attention, swaying her dark hair from side to side as she danced.
Eventually a guy tried to dance with Becky, she wasn't showing much interest at first but then he started to sort of grind up against her, which she stopped but they then danced together in the same rhythm. He put his hand around her waist before trying to move his hands lower and lower from her back down over her ass. She didn't seem to mind too much and smiled keeping her hair from her face with her hands multiple times so he could see she was enjoying it. He seemed to take this as his cue and moved his hand down to her legs. A huge group of people now watched, fascinated by where this may go and I was watching intently from a distance completely ignoring all that was going on around me.
The guy dancing with Becky was dancing away and slowly moving his hand further and further up her leg and so far Becky wasn't stopping him at all. He then moved his hand what must have been too far as her smile dramatically changed to a face of shock, she batted his hand away but he wasn't stopping and pulled her closer now with both hands firmly on her ass -- she tried to push him away but he was just laughing, at which point Rachel and some other girls grabbed him and pulled him away. He scarpered off into the crowds with a few guys giving him high fives. Becky and the girls all promptly came back over to us at the sofa's.
"Oh my word, the Cheek!" Becky screamed.
- "Looked like he had both cheeks!" Andy laughed gaining a huge scowl from all the girls, the boys all laughed.
"He seemed to know just what I'm wearing?" Becky questioned to anyone listening.
- "Yeah everyone knows." Jon responded quite sharply.
"How?!"
- "Well people started asking who you were in the middle and we said you were out on your engagement party and had decided to go out naked under your coat."
"Thanks so much... I'm never going to live this down! You may as well have announced it over the sound system!" Becky angrily ranted.
- "No, you aren't going to live it down. May as well burn all your underwear because from now on people will be more surprised if you're wearing it than the surprise in not wearing it tonight!" Jon responded.
"You'd love that wouldn't you!"
- "Well yeah!"
"You think I'll be walking around in tiny skirts and backless tops all day with nothing underneath..." Becky mocked.
- "Sounds great!"
"Well if I do.. it won't be for you lot!" she continued, looking at me and smiling. "Come on Mister. I wasn't done dancing but I need you to look after me so other guys don't try anything."
We got up and a few of Becky's friends came to join us, as we wandered over to the dance floor it was like the whole place was looking at us, and to an extent they were. Becky refused to be phased by the attention and just started to move to the beat. She raised her arms and started to bend her knees and sway her hips quite sensually. I put my arms around her waist and she smiled at me as we danced.
A circle of people started to form around us, many with camera phones flashing. Becky turned around so that she could grind her ass up against my crotch, as she did this she moved my hands to her chest. I put my hands firmly on her breasts and she then pulled the jacket apart to reveal more and more of the skin between her breasts while my hands stopped the material going too far. The crowd of people around us were stood in awe, some shouting approvingly but most just smiling and watching intently, fascinated by the show. Becky leaned back and turned her head to face me as best she could so she could smile at me.
Then Becky started to reach for the belt buckle on her jacket, as soon as she touched it there was a cheer. She very slowly began to loosen the belt, making sure she held the jacket closed while untying it. Once the belt was undone she continued to hold the coat closed but moved the sides further and further apart so you could see a huge gap from her neck down to her now exposed belly button, her hands holding it closed above her pussy but with her chest almost completely on show apart from her nipples.
She closed the jacket again and began to stick her leg out, parting the material over her thigh more and more and then pulling it further apart well above her hip so you could see there was definitely no underwear at all underneath. The crowd around us was going crazy with guys jumping around. Becky soon turned back around and while facing me re tied the belt to hold her coat together.
"Now they know for sure. But they aren't getting any more -- Take me away from here so we can take this thing off properly!" Becky demanded staring deep into my eyes.
- "Gladly! But I'm curious just how far you'd go with this? You pretty much just stood there topless!" I asked delicately as we walked away from the dance floor to a quieter corner.
"The way I'm feeling I'd go a lot further... if I didn't know 20 people in this club and have to see them again most days for the next year!"
- "How far?" I asked curiously, my heart racing at the prospect of what she might say or do.
"I'd probably dance on that little stage with a pole on it. I think then I would feel like a stripper so I would act like one!..." She grinned.
- "You'd strip?"
"Yeah!" Becky answered quite firmly.
- "But if you stripped out of your coat..?"
"I'd be up there naked!"
- "And you would do that? If there weren't loads of your friends here?!"
"Yeah I would!" She stated happily. "Oh well, maybe another place and another time." She continued playfully.
With this revelation my intentions rapidly changed and my desire to get out of there so I could get her to myself changed. All I wanted to do was see her strip in that crowded nightclub. But she just wouldn't do it if her friends were there so I needed to keep Becky in the club and get her friends out. There was also the fear she may be thrown out if she stripped naked. At this point an idea formed and I left Becky alone a minute to go speak to the security men near the main entrance.
"You see the girl there in the short blue coat?" I asked the large men, they looked at me and frowned. "The brunette with hair to her shoulder? Long legs?" I continued until they nodded. "Well she isn't wearing anything underneath that coat."
- "Nice! how do you know that?" One of them replied happily.
"Yeah very nice, She's my fiancee. But what's even better is she just said to me she would like to do a pole dance and strip out of the coat... if she didn't have a load of her friends here..."
- "I see."
"Can you see where I am going with this?"
- "Yeah I think so, we make the friends leave, you make sure she strips. Sounds like a fair deal to me." The biggest of the doormen said calmly.
"And you don't mind having... such exposure in your establishment?"
- "We don't mind, if people want to show a little skin that's their choice."
"A little?"
- "Well ok a lot of skin!" He added laughing.
"Great. I'll go back over to her, her friends are all on the sofas to the right of the bar, -smoking weed- I'll make sure they're all together." The staff nodded in mutual understanding as I wandered back over to Becky.
"What was that about?" Becky enquired as I went back to her.
- "I'll tell you in a second. Is everyone over on the sofas?" I asked urgently.
"Yeah why?" She replied as I nodded to the doormen who came through straight to the group of Becky's friends. They all sat up quickly and looked massively confused, some of them quite annoyed but they didn't fight too hard as the staff walked them out the club in mass. On their way out some asked about us but I heard the bouncers say we were fine but they had to go.
"What did you just do?!" Becky shouted sounding confused, upset but also a little excited.
- "Me?.... Now there's no one here who knows you... Oh look that pole is free!" I excitedly pointed out.
Becky smiled and then looked down waiting a while as if she were contemplating her next move. Still facing the ground her eyes looked up at me and she cracked a huge smile before bursting into life. She grabbed my hand and pulled me toward the small stage with a pole in the centre of it. She jumped onto the stage which was a couple of feet higher than the floor and started to swing around the pole happily. People soon noticed she was there and with so many of them having been tipped off earlier about her lack of garments they flocked around her like she were a celebrity. Those who weren't in on it were soon told as word spread around the crowd. Some of the security staff also came back in wanting to observe, they looked over at me and nodded pleased to see her on the stage.
Attention was now firmly on my fiancée and she was loving it. Before long her dance moves were getting more and more erotic, but she was still firmly covered with her jacket. She swayed her hips provocatively with her legs slightly apart, knees bent and back to the pole Her head rolled back and she held her arms up to the pole then slowly moved them down over her face onto her chest.
The crowd cheered as she caressed her own breasts and moved her hands down further to the belt on her coat which was still tied. Soon she had her thumbs looped underneath it, tugging gently on the belt. Her head rolled forward and she had her mouth open seductively, looking lustfully at the crowd of people watching her. They cheered as she bit her lower lip and began to untie the belt buckle. Cheers and whistles grew louder and louder until there was a clear chant of,
"Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!"
Becky knew she had everyone's attention now and what they wanted so was going to enjoy the tease. I doubt anyone seriously thought she would take anything off, even if they had believed she was naked under her coat, but they wanted it all the same and a lot of people stood waiting on the glimmer of hope she may actually show the goods.
Similarly to how she had earlier when dancing with me, only this time leaning back against the pole, Becky stuck her leg out and pulled the material over her thigh further and further back revealing more and more of her skin. This time she had also pulled the right side of the coat across her front so it was covering all the way to her opposite arm and leg, she then let the other side slide more and more down her left shoulder. The material slipped lower and lower down her arm revealing the bare skin next to her breast, her side and the whole of her left leg. The crowd erupted as this showed her entire left side and removed any last doubts that she was naked under her coat because virtually her entire left side was completely exposed.
Becky then leaned back against the pole again and let the material slip off her left arm completely. With her right arm still sleeved she held the coat crookedly over her front but her back was now exposed with just a hint of material covering her arse as it was trapped between her skin and the pole. She stepped forward and the coat swung away from her body revealing her entire back and ass, leaving them completely exposed. The small stage she was on was round in shape and not up against a wall so people could stand 360 degrees around it, this meant it was nearly impossible to reveal parts of her body to everyone at the same time and would make any teases harder to pull off.
Years back when I was first getting intimate with Becky she wasn't too keen to show off her ass, in fact she was always quite shy about her whole body. She took a long time before she wore a thong in front of me but pretty quickly after doing so she became comfortable enough to walk around my house completely naked. Here she was remaining unfazed with her whole backside naked and on show in a nightclub full of people watching! She kept dancing in such a way you'd think she did this kind of thing all the time and had all the confidence in the world.
Still holding her coat across her chest Becky managed to get her right arm out of its sleeve so she now just held the coat loose over her front. She moved around the stage enough that everyone watching got a view of her exposed ass which they all appreciated and cheered at. Then she took an even more bold move and managed to climb a few more feet up the pole with just one arm and her leg wrapped around it, getting herself so she could press her thighs together from either side of the pole to hold her in place and sit up. Her coat was pressed against her front between her body and the pole meaning she could briefly let go of the jacket with her hands and hold the pole while she wriggled her hips and got more stable.
Then with her legs tightly squeezed she balanced, suspended halfway up the pole with it pressed against her pussy and her thighs. One arm was holding her stable so she could stretch her long exposed legs out and cross them at her feet. She then leaned back, holding the coat over her boobs with her spare hand while holding the pole tightly with her other. I could sense she was unsure about her next move so after rocking a little to check her stability, she kept her legs crossed at her feet and bent her knees until they latched onto the pole underneath her. With her legs locked this way she had her pussy and thighs pressed one way and her locked ankles pushing the other way meaning she was fairly secure on the pole. Becky then let go of the pole with her holding arm and managed to lean her body completely backward. Her weight would have been uneven but to counter this she let both her arms stretch away from her body and with what must have been a huge amount of core strength and pressure between her legs, her whole body was laying flat, her top half and upper legs positioned like she were on a cross.
Becky's coat was just now resting on top of her like a loose tablecloth. She then began to tilt backward more and more so her head got lower and lower to the stage while her knees raised higher and higher the opposite side. The crowd was going berserk and I was just in awe.
Still suspended in the air she had her head back, hair going crazy dangling down from head and arms pointing out as far as they could, her coat began to slip nearer and nearer to her face revealing more and more of her thighs at the other end. The blue material seemed to linger a moment but then it slipped further and we saw the pole pressed right up against naked skin. People went crazy as they realised her shaved pussy was in view right against the metal pole. The people the other side of the stage didn't have the same great view but her completely naked back and legs still looked outrageously sexy from behind and those seeing it cheered wildly.
Becky clearly knew the coat was slipping but kept her arms stretched out as it crept further up her body and closer to the ground beneath. More and more skin was showing above her pussy until her belly button crept into view. With her face now covered by the coat she let her body tilt back further so she was almost entirely upside down. At that point the coat then just fell off her body entirely, revealing absolutely everything to the astonished crowd.
Becky took a moment to soak in the cheers and probably gain some composure as the crowd reacted wildly and she took in what was happening, hanging there totally naked. With her arms reached out her stomach was a gorgeous tight view and her soft but perky breasts lay stretched flat, looking smaller than than they were. She then reached her hands down and put them on the stage before releasing her legs from the pole and cartwheeling backward into a standing position. The crowd gave a deafening roar while she stood there two foot up on stage revealing everything.
Becky stood naked, she smiled and bowed to the crowd with her arms open wide, walking to four sides of the small stage and repeating so everyone could get a good look at her firm perky breasts, toned stomach, long tight legs and incredibly sexy shaved pussy. She looked me in the eyes as I clapped furiously and cheered, her face beaming with happiness as the excitement filled us both.
Becky stood there a moment while everyone cheered and then went to pick up her coat and come down from the stage, but just as she crouched down there was a huge jeer. A voice screamed "We want more!" And almost instantly all the men were chanting "We want more! We want more!" Becky stood back up and gestured with her arms to calm down, her body language saying "Ok I'll stay... but I'm not sure what to do."
She soon grabbed the pole with her right arm and hooked her leg on it. Stretched out like a starfish she span around the pole gracefully, bending her right knee enough to take some support on the pole with her other arm and leg mirroring the positions but flying free in the air. After spinning around the pole a few times she decided to stand with her back pressed against the pole, one arm up holding it above her head and the other caressing her body.
She opened her legs wider while provocatively grinding her hips from side to side and back and forth, crouching further and further down until her ass rested on the heels of her shoes. Becky continued to grind her hips, opening and closing her legs until she then leaned forward and rested on her hands and knees. On all fours she pressed her boobs together while looking a stranger with a camera pointed her right in the eye. She sat up, still on her knees and moved her hands sensually up her body over her face and into her hair. She bounced her hair around while closing her eyes and turning her head to the side, her body now humping the air like she were riding a person underneath her.
"Masturbate! Masturbate! Masturbate!" The crowd now chanted. Becky smiled and bit her fingers seductively. Moving her hands across her skin and down toward her pussy, she continued to grind her hips while she placed her hand over her pussy and began to rub it gently. She then moved her middle finger more and more over the opening while she faced the crowd and bit on the fingers of her free hand like a gag.
Still on her knees her masturbating hand moved faster and faster while she rolled her head around and caressed her breasts with the other. As the crowd whooped and cheered loudly she moved faster and faster until her eyes opened wider than ever before, then they suddenly closed shut and she stopped moving at all. She sat up straight still on her knees as wave upon wave of ecstasy filled her convulsing body. Moments later she opened her eyes and saw hundreds of faces looking at her cheering, she went bright red and immediately reached for her Jacket. She put her coat back on and jumped down from the stage straight into my arms.
"You ok?" I asked sincerely
- "Yeah.." Becky puffed looking flushed and gasping for air. "What came over me?"
"I don't know but it was incredible!" I encouraged her as she stood embarrassed with lots of people smiling at her and then turning away to carry on with their evenings. A few came up and screamed loudly in our ears about how great she was, we just laughed until they went away. "That's just got me thinking." I added.
- "What has?" Becky quizzed looking concerned.
"Well although all your friends left, there were a lot of people here to see this and there were a lot of pictures and videos taken!"
- "Oh god..."
"These people will talk of the most legendary night when a hot girl stripped naked at this club while pole dancing. They will post pictures online and forward videos to their friends.. It will spread like wildfire and people you know will surely find out."
- "Oh no...." Becky sighed looking downbeat. "Maybe I should just burn all my underwear like Jon said."
"But I don't think people will believe it. I mean they will want too, theres evidence, some where even here earlier to see a bit of skin but unless they saw the whole show they wont really believe it - and you're not known for anything like this so it will become more a mystery of if you really did or not, some will believe some won't." I began to explain as we walked out the club, gaining cheers from those who saw us leave and a few pats on the back from the security men.
- "You're right! Well I hope you are, Monday could be very interesting in lectures... Especially if I only wear the coat then too!"
