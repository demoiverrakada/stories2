*** Authors Note: Part 2 obviously picks up where Part 1 left off. While I make the suggestion to read from the beginning, a couple of refresher notes:
Characters previously introduced:
Phil - Main protagonist. Wealthy 40-something white male who reshaped his entire life following a workplace accident. Has had a lifelong tendency to act rather impulsively, sometimes with mixed results.
Stacy - Phil's physical therapist and friend.
Paul - Phil's live-in personal assistant. A minor character at most.
Phil and Stacy, after weeks of working together to regain Phil's strength and mobility, had just had sex for the first time and agreed that occasional sex between them moving forward would be a mutually satisfactory proposition.
This second part features less actual sex than the first part (ie, none) but continues to build the relationships and scenarios (nudity and teasing) that will see the action pick up in subsequent releases. Keep your eyes open for more in the near future! I hope you enjoy.
*****
Stacy hadn't lied. Our afternoon workout was tough that day. She was really ramping up my weights and resistance training as my stability was really coming back. If I didn't know better it was like she was making it extra difficult just to prove a point that "work comes first." Though, if I can pat myself on the back, I got through with nothing more than a peep of discomfort.
I knew I was her last appointment that day when she did something I was not expecting
.
"Hey, do you want to come over to my place for dinner?"
I had a smirk on my face when I answered a moment later.
"Dinner, huh? I thought that would be relegated to 'relationship' status couples."
"Quit it, jerk," she responded in mild embarrassment. "Yes or no?"
"Of course, just have to find a ride there."
I owned a car, a few of them to be exact. However most of them were in storage and the one I kept on site I had basically given to Paul.
"You find a way to get there and I will make sure you get home, okay?"
"Sounds good. I will bring some wine."
Stacy wrote down her address. She might as well have lived in Milwaukee, I had so little clue as to the geography of my new city. I really needed to get out more and apparently tonight was going to be the catalyst to get that going.
Stacy asked that I show up around 6:30. It worked out well because that is when I normally ate dinner with Paul but also because she said it gave her the time to get home and cleaned up before I got there. It also gave me time to do the same.
I had a talk with Paul, who explained to me that it really was not a big deal when I made last minute plans changes. As he tended to be cooking for only 1-3 people it wasn't as if he had a ton of effort into meal changes one way or the other. I reminded myself that he deserved a bonus with how great he was with his flexibility.
After checking out her address using online maps I decided that I was going to get my old bike out of storage and use it to get over to Stacy's house. She, unlike me, did live in a detached, single family home. It was well inland but, by bike, would still only take me about 20 minutes to get there. It was a beautiful night and seemed like a perfect way to appreciate my surroundings as opposed to a cab. So, strapping the bottle of Old Vine Zinfandel to my handlebars, I hit the road with high hopes for an enjoyable dinner.
As it turned out, Stacy lived on a nicer street than I expected. It was filled with quaint, very well maintained homes. I admit that I wouldn't have expected her to have made enough money to live here but was ashamed of myself for the thought process even beginning.
Pulling into her driveway I found she lived in one of the middle-of the road houses on the block, a picturesque standard Florida ranch. I felt a little like I was back in high school, tucking my bike around the corner of the house and out of view before making my way up to the front door.
Stacy had stressed at the end of PT2 that dinner was going to be extremely casual so I really shouldn't go overboard with what I was dressed in or what type of wine I was bringing. Taking it to heart I was wearing a very casual pair of shorts and a loose v-neck T. There is no way anyone would have accused me of being overdressed except for at a nudist resort.
Wait a minute...
Thankfully, Stacy opened the door a moment later fully clothed... at least she was fully clothed by the most loosely defined version of the words.
Her long-ish brown hair was still wet and down, different from the ponytail I normally saw her with. She was wearing what I would refer to as an extremely loose, extremely thin cut-off t-shirt that somehow both hung off her body aimlessly at the same time as accentuating her feminine breasts and stomach. She was also not wearing shorts or pants, instead just what appeared to be a large silk sari wrapped around her waist that was, because of the tie, cut so far up one of her legs was practically bare. It appeared she was not wearing anything else.
"Hey!"
She greeted me enthusiastically and pulled me in for a very quick, casual one-armed hug and kiss on the cheek.
"You obviously found the place. Any issues getting here? Did Paul drop you off or did you taxi it?"
"Neither. You are actually looking at the oldest kid on the block," I responded. "I rode my bike."
"Nice!"
Stacey kind of pulled me into the house and then closed the door behind me.
"Okay, so I still have some things to finish up. You can take a look around if you want or otherwise I figured we would sit out back."
She pointed me toward the back of the house where I saw a set of french doors that were opened up to a patio.
"Make yourself comfortable. Mi casa e su casa."
With that, she skirted away, back to the kitchen I suppose, leaving me in the joint entryway/living room.
It was a nice space. Clean, comfortable, airy. I looked around the room. Pretty typical. Not overly feminine, not overly anything. Just a normal, American space.
"Why don't you get that wine opened up?"
She called out to me from the kitchen and I followed her voice to where I found her working over a frying pan.
"Fish tacos," she said.
"I guess I shouldn't have brought red," I responded, holding up the bottle of wine.
"Nah, I never get hung up on that stuff. Besides, I like red better anyhow. Crack it open and pour."
Stacy handed me a wine key and I pulled the cork on the bottle. I brought it out to the back patio and, again, I found a nice, clean space that looked like it could have been in a Home Depot flier.
Making my way back to the kitchen, Stacy was finishing up. She directed me to grab a tray of fixin's: lettuce, tomato, peppers, onion, etc. She had a little bit of everything available. She herself had a tray of the lightly fried fish, a bowl of white rice and some sort of sauce.
"C'mon," she hurried me as she walked out into the back. "I'm still hungry from this morning."
Her acknowledgement of our earlier dalliance brought a smile to my face. It was somehow fresh in my mind and yet seemed so long ago.
She plopped us down and did the honors of pouring us each a glass of wine.
"Thanks for coming," she said, holding up her glass for cheers. "I have been meaning to have you over for what seems like now, I am glad it finally came together."
We chimed glasses and got down to eating the deliciously light meal she had prepared for us. So many people think you can't eat well when you are watching calorie counts and food intake. I counter those people are just not eating the right things.
Our conversation was open and organic. She opened up about how her burgeoning business was going. Which, as it turns out, was very well, but driving her a bit crazy with the schedule. I also opened up a bit about my past. I did not go into every single detail about my past relationships and wealth, but I did speak briefly about the fact that yes, I had been divorced and how I was "starting over."
As our dialogue progressed, I learned a couple things about Stacy. First, she was a little bit older than I thought she was at 35, only 7 years my junior as opposed to the 14 I originally guessed. She too had been divorced. She was also in the process of "starting over." She had come out of college and worked HR in a large-ish company. During and after her divorce she realized she had just been playing it safe with her career and decided to give something a go that would help her both personally and professionally and got into personal training. It had been a rocky path getting started, mostly financially, but she was really turning a corner and was glad she made what she feels was the right choice.
I watched her in wonder, marveling at how natural she was. Her shirt hung far off one shoulder, very loose in front of her and just gently grazing her nipples that were visible underneath. Her silk wrap might as well have not been there. It hung so far open I could see her smooth, toned and tanned legs in full with occasional flashes of her trimmed pubic hair as she moved. Again, as at the beach just the day before, she was not taunting me with her charms, just incredibly comfortable in her lovely, earned physique.
We had been finished with dinner and were finishing up the bottle of wine when she requested that we move over to the lounge furniture as she was a bit uncomfortable. Plopping ourselves down on the soft, outdoor couch that was nearby, Stacy put her feet up on my lap and sighed.
"This is nice."
Indeed it was.
Our conversation continued but we also just relaxed. I am sure she was exhausted after a long day of work. I myself took the opportunity to be a little handsy. With her long, smooth legs on my lap, it seemed like an appropriate time to offer an impromptu and informal leg and foot massage. And, while I am not going to go so far as being one of those tools who call them their specialty, I believe I have enough skill to make them enjoyable for the recipient.
Stacy was no different.
As I worked on her feet and calves she stretched out on the couch like a cat waking up from a nap; her shirt pulling up on her chest until the bottom curve of both her breasts was clearly exposed.
"Good, lord," she sighed, "that feels incredible. Apparently I took advantage of you in the wrong way this morning."
"You most certainly did not!"
Her response was only to take one of her feet and rub her toes into my crotch while simultaneously blowing me a kiss and pulling up her shirt to flash her breasts.
Yup, that got me a bit hard.
We continued relaxing for a little while, my hands making themselves up and down every inch of her legs but stopping short of her basically completely exposed pussy, lost in the moment. I admit I had zoned out a bit when my trance was broken by the sound of a voice.
"Whatcha' up to there, folks?"
I looked up to find another woman standing in the doorway. She was dressed in light blue hospital scrubs and looked somewhat tired.
"Hey, you."
Stacy sat up and straightened out her clothes, not in any sort of hurried manner, more just as a matter of habit.
"Home from work. What's going on?"
Stacy put her hand on my leg and gestured to the mystery woman.
"Phil, this is my roommate Karen. Karen, this is my friend Phil."
Karen began walking over and I stood to meet her. A quick handshake and greeting and our standard, cursory American introduction is complete.
"What are you doing home so early," Stacy inquired.
"Not early, babe. It is already 10:30. My shift was over."
That certainly surprised me. Four hours had come and gone in a flash.
Stacy looked over at me. "Wow, I can't believe it got that late."
We all stood quietly for a moment and I realized that was my queue.
"Well, guess that makes it time for me to head out. Karen, it was nice to meet you. Stacy, thank you for dinner and the company. I guess I will see you in the morning."
We all exchanged pleasantries and I walked out the front door into the night. It wasn't like I was expecting to have sex again that night, not that I would have turned it down, but it was a somewhat disappointing and abrupt ending to the evening. Getting on my bike and riding out into the calm, comfortable Florida night, I was still happy. Happy with how my life was so far turning out after making so many drastic changes in it at one point. Also happy with how much living I knew I had left to do.
-------------------
The next 6 months or so were a whole lot of same ol', same ol' that I had gotten used to before our "lunchtime fuck." Stacy was my therapist, physical trainer and friend, but there was absolutely no sex at all. We had meals together often and even went to a movie a couple of times but the physicality was non-existent. It was a bit sad but not the end of the world. I was taking my bike out much more often. Taking in the sites of my new home city and getting accustomed to the lay of the land. I was trying out new, varied restaurants with quite a bit of success and getting a handle on the vibe of the community I lived in. Plus, in an odd way, there was still quite a bit of sensuality between us. Lots of flirting, lots of "innocent" touching. Just no penis-in-vagina action. On more than one occasion I feel that talking about or acting on it was something that both of us would have taken advantage of but, for a variety of distractions each time, it just didn't happen.
Paul and I were starting to realize that my need (loosely defined) for him during my recovery was coming to an end but he agreed to stay on as long as I felt like it. When I first hired him I had been under the assumption/hope that we would have developed more of a friendship but that didn't end up being the case. He was more like a productive ghost. As long as he was okay with that I was too. It was probably a great deal for him as well. I still paid him quite well and he still had a free room and car. Why give up a good thing?
I had joined two social groups that were beginning to keep me occupied a little bit more, though, I could admit to myself, now that my physical condition was pretty much back to normal, I was starting to get bored with not having a day job. One of the groups was a cycle tour group. Basically a pack of like-minded people who would take leisurely rides around the city once a month and stop in at a couple of bars along the way to grab a drink and/or bite to eat. It was fun and it was enjoyable but, at only once a month, it was not a major block in my social calendar.
The second group, make fun of me if you want, was actually a Scrabble club.
Yes, the board game. Yes, it was with old people.
I found out about the club after seeing a posting on the wall in the lobby of my building. I figured since I lived in what was generally considered to be such a young area of town it was going to be with younger, if nerdier, people. I was surprised, but not repelled, by the fact that it was an older group. While the biking group was mostly people in their 20's and 30's, not married. This group was mostly a bunch of people in their 60's, empty nesters who wanted to get back into the social scene but were not part of the bar crowd. That said, this group did apparently have a couple of parties each year that were apparently wild events and I was looking forward to those as well. Similar to the bike club, it was only twice a month, not doing too much to fill my need for some fulfillment.
PT sessions were down to three days a week, one session per day with Stacy. Massages were down to just once a week. I didn't see her any less as she was in my apartment often, but it was different.
All in all, life continued to be good, I was just bored.
IMPULSE: I needed something to do, I needed something different. It was a very hot weekend day when I decided to check out that nude beach formally. I was feeling good about my physical shape and wanted some sun, what better place to do it?
RESULT: I had taken to embracing a more bohemian Florida lifestyle and had upgraded by downgrading my bike. I got rid of my old, high-end mountain bike and was now riding a true beach cruiser. It had huge, wide tires and a rack over the rear wheel that allows me to carry quite a bit of cargo. My cargo of choice for that day was a folding beach chair, umbrella, towel, and a cooler/bag combo that contained some drinks/snacks as well as sunscreen and the latest book I was reading.
The beach was busy (but still not crowded) by my limited experience with such places. I probably spotted about 150 people spread out along the expanse of beach. While I knew that naturist beaches in Europe could literally be shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, I assumed it was different in the US, especially at a beach that was not (to my knowledge) publicized.
I set myself up smack dab in the middle of the sand. Probably about 50 meters away from the closest people. Plopping myself down, I immediately began the most appropriate activity there is for any beach.
People watching.
As expected, the majority of the people that were within immediate eyesight were men. Of course someone is going to say that it must be because men are perverts and very willing to expose themselves in order to see someone else exposed. I think it is because men, in general, don't get as hung up on their bodies as women do and therefore don't mind being out in the nude and possibly seen by others. Yes, there is always the issue with penis size, but once you get over that there isn't much else to worry about. It wasn't exactly a full census that I was taking, but I would probably say it was about 60% men and 40% women overall. The women tended to be with a single male or female companion and I saw a couple small female only groups but I did not spot a female alone by herself. Not surprising and not that I cared. Just something I noticed.
I had been out in the sun for a while when I decided it was time to cool off. Floating around in the gulf water I marveled at how many years I had been busting my ass making money instead of stopping to smell the roses and enjoy the pleasures the world had to offer. I didn't even have to travel anywhere, the water was available for free.
I had been floating on my back, not paying attention when a small wave, caused by the wake of a boat, washed over my face and got into my eyes and up my nose. Blinded, hacking and realizing how long I had been in the water anyhow, I determined it was time to get out. Of course for men this can often be the most fear worthy part of the experience, shrinkage and all. Thankfully that day the water was extremely warm and I didn't need to worry about it too much.
Again though, why should I even care?
I was making my way back to where I thought my chair was but was having difficulty based on the seawater's lasting distortion of my vision. I saw that shapes that I thought were my belongings but noticed a flesh colored object in the chair. Someone else was there.
It took a moment to clear my eyes and mind but, wouldn't you know it, Stacy was sitting there.
"We have to stop meeting like this, Phil!"
She hopped out of my chair and jumped into me, wrapping me again in a sweaty, salty hug that immediately brought back the memories of that day so long prior. My dick went from practically shriveled to half mast.
"Hey there," she said, reaching her hand between us and wrapping my fingers around me. "Don't you know it's bad form to get an erection on a nude beach."
Because it helped shield the fact, I kept her pulled closed against me.
"Yeah? Well you can blame yourself for that one, Stace. I was having no issues at all until you showed up."
"Ooooooo, this is because of me? Well," she purred, "aren't you the sweet talker. You certainly know how to make a woman feel good about herself."
I know she was busting my chops and playing up the situation but it didn't change the fact that this erection, pressed up against her right then, felt really nice. The warmth of her body against my otherwise cool skin was as naturally pleasurable as it got.
I gently pushed her off of me and plopped myself down in my chair, eyeballing left and right to see if anyone noticed before I pulled my towel up and laid it across my lap.
"Do you have a day off," I asked her. That was the circumstance of our last encounter and I hadn't thought her schedule was getting any easier.
"Vacation. Well, stay-cation actually. Not going anywhere but not doing anything either for a whole week."
Had I missed something?
"Wait, what? Did you cancel our appointments for the next week? I guess I wasn't paying attention."
Stacy stood in front of me, her golden skin glistening in the sun, tiny beads of sweat on her skin.
"Everybody but you, Phil. I have no reason to cancel the appointments of my favorite client. Being with you isn't work at all."
I chuckled. "Well! Aren't you the one who knows how to make a guy feel good about himself!"
"I try!"
I was still shifting, trying to get my erection under control when Stacy stepped up and started taking my umbrella down.
"What are you doing?" I honestly had no idea.
"Taking you with me, silly. There is no way we are going to be on the same beach and not spend time together."
Stacy took almost everything. I was left standing there, naked and with my bike in the sand, as she struggled with an armload of my belongings up towards the vegetation line.
Getting to where she had already been situated I saw how perfect her little area was. It had a decent combination of direct sun as well as shade dependent on moving a few feet one way or the other. Her setup was even more minimalist than mine. Aided by the shade of a couple of palms, she did not have an umbrella, just a towel, small chair and a bag. She arranged my chair, towel and cooler next to her and directed me to get seated before doing so herself.
Whether it was in the gym or any of our social interactions, Stacy was always the more "take-charge-r" of the two of us and I was fine with that. I had nothing to do and nowhere to be, why stress out?
We got right back into our standard, daily topics of discussion and I experienced exactly what every regular had ever said about a nude beach: it isn't sexual. Any erection that had developed when Stacy held me previously was gone. I was just hanging out with a friend, enjoying the beautiful weather and excellent company. The benefit of an all-over tan just went along with that.
We had been talking for a while when her phone rang. She indicated that it was a call she needed to take and stepped about 30 feet away where she was able to speak in relative privacy. It also gave me the ability to marvel at her body again. I couldn't believe she was 35. Which is not to say that it is old in any way, just that her body showed no sign of aging at all. She was obviously a woman as opposed to a teenage girl, but that said, her body could have easily passed for 10 or 15 years younger.
Stacy came back and sat down again.
"Sorry about that."
"No problem at all."
We didn't get right back into our previous conversation. Instead we just sat quietly for a while, people watching and enjoying the weather.
Stacy was the first to speak.
"Lord, I need to get out here more often," she said.
I guess I was surprised to hear it.
"How often do you come out here? I have been here a grand total of twice and you were here both times. Judging by that and the fact that you have no tan lines that I can immediately see I would have assumed you were a regular."
"Checking me out, are you?" Stacy stood again and began checking herself out. Twisting and contorting as she attempted inspected her body. "I guess you are right," she said, "I don't have any tan lines." She moved herself and was standing directly in front of me. My natural line of site was directly into her cleanly sculpted and trimmed pubic mound.
"It stands to reason though. To answer your question, I don't come out here often at all. Besides the two times that I have seen you I have been out here once additionally and that was before even the last time I saw you. Besides that I haven't gone to any beach at all. While I am a bit surprised that I don't have tan lines from just normal clothing it apparently just didn't happen. Those are the setbacks and benefits of working indoors all of the time. We take the weather for granted, you know? We have this amazing thing right here at our fingertips and instead of taking advantage of it we always put it off for another day."
The closeness of her sensual, toned body was starting to have an effect on me. I wanted to kiss her all over, feel her breasts in my hands and my plunge my tongue into her groomed sex. The heat of the air was not helping the situation at all as it felt difficult to try and get deep breaths to calm myself.
It was Stacy who calmed me, or at least snapped me out of my day dream. She started walking away from in front of me and I could see that she was waving.
"Over here!"
Who was she talking to? I focused my energy and breathing into calming any sort of pre-erectile state before even attempting to make a guess as to who Stacy was gesturing towards.
A familiar looking woman was walking over toward us and seemed to have a combination snicker/scowl on her face.
"What the fuck, Stace! You said to meet you at the beach. Were you planning on ever mentioning that it was a nude beach?!"
Stacy was laughing. "Nope. Because if I did I knew you wouldn't ever show up. Hey, babe, come get yourself setup with us."
I immediately felt a bit insecure in my own skin. Part of the successful formula of making a naturist beach work is that everyone is nude... or at least aware that other people were nude. This friend of hers was not.
Rude as it might be, I stayed seated. It seemed I had more coverage that way.
Stacy was helping take some of the items her friend was carrying, which were minimal. It seemed she had a large beach bag and an umbrella.
"This is my friend, Phil," Stacy said, gesturing over to me.
"Hi, pleased to meet you," her friend responded and stepped over to me, stooping down with an outstretched hand, mercifully not making me stand up. "I'm this bitch's roommate, Karen."
Karen?
"Karen!"
Both of the women were a bit surprised at my exclamation. Why would have I just shouted her name? They stood there, first looking at me and then at each other with confused looks on their faces.
"Sorry about that," I laughed. "We've actually met before. Very briefly. I came over to your house for dinner once a number of months back and we crossed paths as you were getting home from work."
"Wait," Karen said, looking at Stacy. "Phil? That Phil? Your client?"
Had they been talking about me?
"Oh, yeah. I forgot about that." Stacy's response was not particularly believable.
"I walked in on you two out on the patio. You were practically naked then and you're fully naked now. What aren't you telling me?"
"Cut it out." Stacy's reply was more like a plea for help as she turned her back to her friend and sat back down in her chair.
"Whatever."
Stacy had her head down, barely able to look at me it seemed, and Karen continued getting herself situated. She was pulling off her thin, shapeless beach cover-up when I reminisced back to the day we met. She was wearing scrubs that day and looked tired. Pretty nondescript otherwise.
Today was a bit different.
Her cotton dress removed, Karen revealed an absolutely phenomenal body. She was wearing a tiny black string bikini. Absolutely tiny. This was something out of a WickedWeasel or Malibu Strings catalog but, believe me, it was totally appropriate for her. It appeared that her breasts were most likely implants but were implant works of art. Her waist was thin and her butt, each cheek separated by a thin black g-string, was deliciously curvy. Her face was pretty and her body basically unbelievable. Honestly, she is a fantasy artist's dream and the bane of all "regular" women everywhere. I was surprised at how pale her skin was against the backdrop of golden sand and the bright sunshine but was nonetheless speechless.
"Are you freaking serious?!" Stacy was just staring at Karen, wide-mouthed.
"What?"
"You are wearing that and you were giving me any sort of shit about being naked?!"
"My tits and cooter are covered, babe. We can't say the same for you."
"Uhm, your tits are totally not covered... babe. Maybe your nips at the most but I think I can even see some of your areola!"
Silence. They were both staring each other down and I was caught, physically frozen in the fear that I would somehow get involved with their spat. I was actually a bit scared to move.
And then... laughter. Both Stacy and Karen burst out into a synchronized roar of laughter.
"Got ya!"
It was a scantily clad version of the scene from "Dumb and Dumber" where Harry and Lloyd put all of the peppers in the hit-man's sandwich and then laughed as he went into convulsions on the floor. Both women were pointing at me and laughing their asses off, incredibly proud of the "trick" they had played.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got me."
The laughter went on for a little longer while Karen finished getting herself situated. She actually had herself setup at my feet. It was a little triangle arrangement where, even though she was sitting up and facing directly toward Stacy, I was offered a clear profile view of her and I could tell her body was just about unreal.
The conversation that started was more of an introduction. Karen and I opened up a little about ourselves. She did not work in a hospital per se, as the scrubs I had previously seen her in had made me assume, rather with a cosmetic surgeon.
"Where do you think she got those tits?"
Stacy's added color commentary prompted a scowl in return.
She, an easy fit in this group, was also divorced. She and Stacy met at the gym and decided to look into a place together as they reconstructed their lives. It seemed she kept a pretty low-key lifestyle. Mostly work, gym and not much else. Similar to what I knew about Stacy, there was not a lot of dating or other social time. Nonetheless, Karen seemed mostly friendly if not just a tiny little bit cool towards me. But, then again, I was sitting naked and about 3 feet away from her.
It had been some time, talking, tanning and snacking when Stacy got up.
"Time to go cool off," she said. She held out her hand for Karen and pulled her up to her feet in an indicator that she had no choice but to go along. "Gonna' join us, Phil?" Stacy was the one who invited me but I did not see any immediate indication from Karen that I was not welcome.
"Maybe just for a moment," I replied as I got up out of my chair. "I was just about to take a stroll up the beach and get my blood flowing but a little cooling off first would be nice."
The water was nice and the conversation was also enjoyable, but honestly I wanted to go for a walk. So, it couldn't have been more than a few moments that I excused myself from the company of the women and made my way back out of the water and down the shoreline.
As it turns out, the length of what appeared to be considered the nude beach was pretty expansive. As an ex-real estate guy myself I was shocked to estimate approximately 1.5 miles of beachfront was clothing-optional and undeveloped and it seemed that I kept walking and walking without much cover-up in sight. My original estimation also probably held true with 60/40 male to female ratio and I was pleased to find a wide variety in ages, shapes and sizes of beachgoers as I continued along. I also found at the far end of the beach there was a small drink/snack cart that was setup for service. All in all, it was a great atmosphere, clean and happy and I was glad that I was taking advantage of the resource I didn't previously know was available.
Turning around and beginning my walk back I assumed that I had been gone for some time and that assumption was confirmed when I got back to approximately where I left the girls in the water and did not find them. So, after a quick dip to re-cool myself I returned to our spot on the sand. Stacy was not there but Karen was. I found her laying on her stomach, up on elbows with her attention focused on her phone. I also saw that she had removed her top and it was sitting to the side of her.
"Hey," I offered out as a general greeting and announcement to my arrival, stepping around her basically naked body and over to my chair.
She seemed startled at first, putting down her phone and pulling her elbows in a bit closer to her in what looked to be an attempt to shield her breasts from sight. Sitting down to the right of her immediate line of sight she seemed a bit more relaxed when she realized it was me but didn't change her physical position at all.
"Oh, hey. You're finally back. We were wondering if you had enough girl time and just went home."
I laughed at her comment and just explained that I really liked walking on the beach.
"Have you been here before?" I inquired.
"No, never. Though Stacy has been trying to get me to come here ever since we met. In the end she just braved it on her own."
"Braved it?"
"Yeah! Being nude. Well, I guess for her it isn't that brave. I can't get over how easy it is for her."
"I'm surprised to hear you say that. If I can be so bold, your bikini doesn't exactly leave much to the imagination."
Karen smiled and responded.
"Yeah, I know. Believe me when I tell you that this is not exactly standard attire for me either. I borrowed this from a girl I know after I agreed to this idiotic plan to mess with you. Stacy knew I had the day off and when she first saw you she immediately called me. I can't believe you couldn't see how bad I was shaking during the entire charade. No offense, you seem like a pretty nice guy, but I am not used to being this exposed around someone I really don't know."
"Understandable, no offense taken."
I was also suddenly nervous about my own nudity again. "You know, if you want me to cover-up as well or leave you and Stacy alone it wouldn't be a problem, I certainly don't want to make you feel uncomfortable."
Karen's reaction was so quick it caught me off guard. "Oh, no! Absolutely not! Stay naked! It's not you, it's me. I wish I had your balls."
She had turned slightly toward me, still holding her breasts tightly against herself and with a look of panic on her face. I couldn't help but smile.
"Not your balls... balls! No. Wait. I am sure your balls are nice as well. They look great! I just wish I had your balls. Shit!"
She was digging herself deeper and deeper into a hole and it was hilarious to watch. I could feel the grin on my face getting bigger.
Karen finally stopped talking and just stared at me, she was visually begging me to let me off hook before she did even more damage.
"Karen, it's okay. I get it. No harm done." I could barely get the words out in between laughs.
She had an audible sigh of relief and buried her face down into her towel in the sand.
"Thanks for the compliment though. At least I think there might have been one in there."
She didn't even lift her face out of the sand but her body was almost convulsing with a sort of combination laugh/cry embarrassment. I felt bad and good at the same time. I didn't want her to feel like an idiot, of course, but on the other hand it was my experience that laughter as often the best form of bonding and keeping the joke going might not be the worst thing.
Stacy conveniently happened to show back up at that point. She came back with a large silk wrap tied around her but immediately undid it and brought every inch of her skin back out into the daylight.
"Hey, you're back," she directed at me as she noticed Karen's odd position. "What's going on here?"
"Karen thinks I have great balls."
"Yeah? Apparently I was gone longer than I thought."
Stacy and I caught one another's eye and I tossed a wink and nod at her, an indication that she should keep it up. As she settled herself into her chair she continued.
"So, Kare... just what is it about Phil's balls that are so great? Is it the way they hang? The delicious ornamentation they add to his additionally stellar cock? Maybe you appreciate the way they bobble to-and-fro as he walks."
She was seriously laying this on thick and I felt a little bad for Karen. I was also slightly surprised to hear Stacy speaking so graphically.
Karen, though, put an end to it. She pulled her face up from her towel and extended the bird, first in the direction of Stacy, then pointed at me. The words out of her mouth were "You two can go fuck yourselves," but all I could focus on was the side of her breast, dangling down from her torso, creamy white and so visually soft. I understood that I shouldn't be staring as that was exactly most likely what she was worried about, I just couldn't help it.
Stacy was laughing.
My jaw was on my chest.
"Sorry, babe. Had to take advantage of the opportunity when I got it." Stacy practically coughed out the words in between laughs as she chastised her friend.
Karen sat herself up, somewhat shielding her breasts, but apparently becoming a bit more bold with what she would possibly show around me or the general public. She could have still been uncomfortable but it wasn't as if she was putting her top back on either. We had been out in the sun for quite some time, in and out of the water, and it was obvious that unless I was desiring a significant amount of discomfort in the coming days a reapplication of sunscreen was necessary. Taking my sunscreen out of my bag I started with my arms, chest and face. The conversation had died down a bit at that point and I found that I had a small audience with both Stacy and Karen absentmindedly watching me.
"Can I get that from you when you're done," Stacy inquired, "I didn't even think of bringing any along with me."
"Same here," chimed Karen.
I was beginning to apply to my legs when I was struck with the knowledge that I was going to have to reapply to my dick as well, it was probably the most sensitive skin on my entire body. The good news for me was that I had done a considerable amount of "manscaping" recently so I didn't need to worry about getting the sunscreen matted into my pubic hair.
The bad news is that it was warm.
The bad, bad news is that it was warm and there were two, beautiful naked or mostly naked women sitting near me.
The bad, bad, bad news is that it was warm with beautiful women and I was basically going to be jerking off in front of them.
Now, I was no stranger to the internet and to perusing some sites associated with "adult" pleasure. I have seen videos of women on European beaches applying sunscreen to their breasts. Those women are somehow able to make it look completely practical and not sexual. I was not necessarily convinced that I was able to make the same display.
I had to get up anyhow, covering the backs of my legs and butt with lotion, reaching around the best that I could and decided that it was the point of no return. I could also feel the eyes of the girls, watching my every move as I painted myself into a corner and had no other area left within my reach but the most obvious.
So, I just did it. I put a dollop of cream in my hands and then went to town.
I tried not to make any sort of eye-to-eye connection with the ladies, I felt that would only make it more awkward, but my paranoia put my peripheral vision into overdrive and I swear I could see looks of amazement on both of their faces as I rubbed the lotion in, slathering my entire length with the thick white lotion. All that heat, all that skin, all that rubbing, the end result was inevitable. I ended up with a very UV protected, very chubby dick.
It is what it is.
"Hey," Stacy interrupted my thoughts. "Come here, let me do your back."
My back. Ah, yes. That needed to be done as well.
"Kneel in front of me."
Stacy was still in her chair and I followed her directions. Of course kneeling in front of her now put me directly into the view of Karen.
Completely nude and directly in front of Karen.
What was I supposed to do, cover my junk? Put my hands on my hips and thrust out for inspection?
Stacy was busy rubbing the lotion into my back and I was fidgety. I could feel my mind going a mile a minute and found my eyes darting around the beach, trying to pass the time when that darting around ended up landing directly on Karen.
Our eyes locked.
She smiled.
I watched her eyes go back to my dick.
I took the opportunity to look at her breasts again, now more in my view.
We locked eyes again.
She mouthed the words, "It's okay."
It's okay?
What does that mean? My dick is okay? It's okay to be nervous? I don't need to be nervous? It's okay to look at her tits?
More than anything I was frustrated with myself. Why was I so unglued around Stacy and now Karen? I had been married before, I had experienced quite a few successful dates that I didn't particularly feel nervous about. Was it because they all knew about my money and were therefore catering to me? Why was I having so much difficulty relaxing and enjoying the moment? I had no problems with my dealings in business. I certainly never had issues dealing with beautiful women. I didn't have any issues with my body. I couldn't figure it out.
I did decide that Karen probably meant that it was okay for me to look at her tits... and look I did. They really were incredible. Probably a small d-cup and hanging down quite naturally on her rib cage. As far as implants go these were phenomenal, looking like a naturally endowed 18-year-old as opposed to a cougar with bolt-ons. Her soft skin was a creamy white and her nipples an inviting pink.
I felt myself quickly getting hard.
Fuck.
I confirmed that Stacy was done with my back and I shuffled my way back over to my chair. I felt my now parallel-to-the-sand dick flapping back and forth, hitting my hips, further stimulating itself and not helping my situation at all. Plopping down on the canvas I couldn't grab a water bottle quick enough to use as a visual shield in my lap.
"Hey," Stacy said to me, "you're not going to return the favor? My back needs sunscreen too." She was busy rubbing lotion on her chest and arms at that point and it looked like her legs and back were the only things left on her to be covered.
"Aw, leave Phil alone," Karen defended, "I'll help you out, you can do my back too."
Karen and Stacy both stood up. Karen was no longer making any attempt to shield herself at all. With only her tiny black g-string covering her she was practically as naked as Stacy. Her breasts were now fully visible and every assumption I had made about them previously was true, they were spectacular. It was practically too good to be true that she was standing next to Stacy, a golden goddess in her own right, sun-kissed and natural. Both of them were a sight to behold.
My erection not only didn't fade away, it became rock hard.
The women were standing in front of me, mostly at a profile view with Stacy behind Karen, ready to apply to her back. Each of them took a large dollop of sunscreen and then Stacy tossed the bottle back to me, landing it right across my erection while I wasn't paying attention. Both of them went to work.
I was not 15 years old. I did not normally get NRB's (No Reason Boner) very often at that point in my life.
I normally had the ability to distinguish between practicality and sensuality.
I also normally had a fully functioning brain.
At that point, I did not.
From Karen rubbing down her own skin to Stacy being nude and just having her hands on her, I was going a bit nuts. Just like the day that Stacy gave me that massage, another version of my own personal hell began. The thought popped into my head that maybe I should masturbate more and get rid of the backup of hormones but it was neither the time or the place to be getting started on that resolution.
Stacy had asked me to help her out, first by giving her more sunscreen in her hands, and then by pulling Karen's bikini strings out of the way so she didn't get any lotion on them. It was a difficult decision for me, getting out of my chair and no longer with the visual protection it had to offer me. What was I supposed to do though, say 'no' when she asked for assistance?
So, I got up.
Thankfully, Karen seemed to be engrossed in her opposite arm and did not pay attention to me as I stepped up to Stacy, sunscreen bottle in hand and my personal divining rod pointed up at her face.
Stacy saw what was happening and gave me a smile and a wink as I put an additional dollop in her hand. I gave her a shrug of resignation, she knew what was causing this.
I figured moving around would have helped my predicament but a couple of things stood in the way of that.
One: just the simple act of pulling the g-string straps and touching Karen's skin was electrically erotic. It forced all sorts of imagery into both of my heads.
Two: Stacy was vicious. I was attempting to calm down, my eyes closed and breathing deeply. I figured it was like lamaze; place focus on something else and the human mind can accomplish anything. Stacy took that as her opportunity to take a greasy, lotion covered hand and give me a couple of excruciatingly pleasant tugs on my cock. Any deep breath attempts were obliterated as it took my breath away.
Opening my eyes, Stacy was sly, with an exaggerated pucker on her lips as she blew me a kiss.
"Karen, make sure you don't get lotion on the bikini, you don't want to give it back smeared with grease." Stacy called to Karen who herself was in the process of covering her hands in an additional glob of sunscreen.
"Really? Crap. What am I supposed to do now," Karen replied, holding her hands up to display them covered in white.
"Have Phil help you like I did, his hands are clean."
I gave Stacy a dirty look. She just smiled in return.
So, there I was, fully hard with an erection smeared with white, streaky sunscreen and something happened. It clicked in my head and the light bulb turned on. They were messing with me. Why was I upset? If anyone had the power hand it was me! I could tease back.
IMPULSE: Time to turn the tables.
I stepped away from Stacy and in front of Karen, close enough for her to feel my physical presence, far enough away that she was not going to be able to miss seeing my cock.
"You need me?" My position was almost comical. I had my arms crossed in front of my chest, and my hips tilted slightly forward, there was no mistaking how I was looking to gain her attention.
"Yeah, can you help me with..." Karen's sentence was cut short coming out of her own mouth. She had eyed my dick and was literally at a loss for words. Now, It isn't like I have some massive porno cock but it isn't like I am small either. I would say I am respectfully above average hard. But, I have to assume when you are not expecting to see the sight, a full blown raging erection will take anyone by surprise.
RESULT: "My hands... are... uhm... greasy."
She could barely get the words out of her mouth or her eyes off my dick. It was incredible. In one fail swoop I went from hunted to hunter. My heart was racing a mile a minute and I felt my pulse as it throbbed through my bobbing hard-on.
"Can't get the suit messed up, huh? I know just what to do."
Her hands were still in the air, she was a deer caught in headlights and completely frozen. I stepped up and rubbed the palm of my left hand all over hers, picking up as much sunscreen as possible onto it.
"The problem here," I whispered in her ear, standing as close to her as possible, "is that once you get both of your hands messy you need the help of someone else. It's a good thing that I kept one of my hands clean."
With my right hand I pulled the front of the g-string away from her body and slowly eased my left hand across her skin.
Slowly.
Deliberately.
I didn't really get a chance to visually inspect the work I was doing, instead I kept my eyes locked on hers as much as possible.
Instead of me, it was Karen who had labored breathing. I wasn't touching her graphically, but I was most certainly touching her sexually.
I continued my process, wiping lotion from her hand onto mine, transferring it to her body, rubbing all around the inside of her pelvis and into the crook of her thighs, not directly touching her sex, but getting so close it was probably even more frustrating, all the while pulling and shifting the g-string down and away from where I was working to the point it was no longer even covering her.
She was still in shock and the sunscreen was just about gone from her hands but I was not yet done. I wiped the final amount off her hands and from in between her fingers, getting just enough on my own hand that it was slick. As a final act of turning the tables I reached around and held her butt, a full, delightful plump in my right hand, and slid my greased-up left hand right down the front of her, right in between her legs. I could feel she was freshly shaved or waxed and there was absolutely no resistance as my skin slid across hers and I continued through to cupping her womanhood, her entire crotch nestled in my palm.
Did I plunge a finger into her? Absolutely not. It is not unreasonable to say that I had already crossed the threshold of inappropriate behavior to take it further would have been ludicrous. Plus, there was absolutely no need as the desired effect was already obtained. I did, however, continued to gently rub the palm of my hand back-and-forth, back-and-forth and additionally tormented her as I forced her body into a rhythm with mine through my grip on her ass.
Power though, is knowing when to advance and when to retreat.
Karen's breathing was in staccato. She had dropped her hands from the air and they were on my shoulders. She stared directly into my eyes with a sort of pleading look. It was obvious that even though my touch was not directly on her clitoris or from within her vulva her erogenous zones were being attacked with an onslaught of stimulation.
So, I stopped.
I stepped away.
"Okay, I think you are done."
I still had a massive erection and did nothing to hide it. Instead I simply sat back down in my chair, leaning back to expose it just ever so much more, and left Karen standing there in an erotic state of shock and with her g-string hoving halfway down her thighs.
I was so damn proud of myself.
"Stacy, are you all set with your UV protection," I asked, "I wouldn't want you getting burned."
Stacy had already sat down and had been watching my spectacle from the comfort of her chair. Looking over at her we caught eyes. She matched the grin on my own face and mouthed the words "bad boy" as she shook her head.
Karen didn't know what hit her. It took her a few moments before she shuffled her way over to her towel and collapsed upon it. Her bikini bottom had drifted down to her knees and the site was as hot as ever. To be perfectly honest, she looked as if she had just been fucked to an unending series of orgasms.
"Hey, Kare," Stacy inquired, "are you okay?"
All we got in response was a half-hearted thumbs up.
I burst out laughing.
"Another player has entered the game, ladies, and he knows how to play!"
Stacy was the only one to respond as Karen was laying on the ground, just starting to regain lucidity. If I didn't know better I think she might have cum.
"I like it. And please, let me say, touche. I think that made the 'game' that much more interesting."
My life was taking an interesting turn and I was appreciating starting over more and more.
---------------
Karen had remained crumpled on her towel for some time, a twisted mess of skin and limbs, her bikini g-string still wrapped awkwardly around her knees. Her chest had been heaving for some time, her breasts bobbing up and down on her chest. The only unfortunate part of the scene was that her body was so contorted it did not allow me to truly take in the rest of her.
As she came to she sat up, almost like someone waking from a deep sleep. "Well, thank you for that secondary introduction, Phil," she said, looking at me in a foggy daze as she sat up and situated herself. One leg at a time, now making no attempt at covering herself, she pulled off the tiny black suit that had previously been covering the last secret part of her body and threw it at me. "I don't think I will be needing that anymore."
I caught the tiny item in the air and put in on my head. My crown, my victory trophy.
Karen continued. "I don't know what the hell you did to me just then but I can make one single guarantee. I will get you back."
She wasn't even looking at me when she said it. Instead she was visually inspecting herself, specifically what that tiny black cloth had previously covered.
Her modesty and nervousness were gone.
Karen was now sitting with her legs spread open and was spreading apart her lips with two of her fingers, exposing her pink to me in all of its glorious detail. Stacy was neither blind nor forgiving of her friend.
"Christ, Kare... are you giving the world enough of a show?!" She was laughing in her inquiry. "I doubt your lady-doc has seen you in that much detail!"
"Oh, who cares. Look at this!" Karen, held up two fingers to Stacy but very much within my view. "I haven't been this wet in years."
The look on Karen's face was priceless. She was totally dumbfounded, like she had absolutely no idea what had happened.
"Bad news, Phil," she said in my direction. "You are most definitely bad news."
I just smiled and shrugged. Stacy was laughing so hard she was practically in tears.
The rest of the afternoon was very nice though short. We just spent time socializing together and it seemed, honestly, that we had developed a rapport in such a short time as a threesome that I could already call Karen my friend. We laughed and talked on the beach and in the water. We went for a walk along the shoreline and I felt the eyes of every guy on the beach checking out the girls and looking enviously at me just for being with them.
The day was great and all too soon, it was done.
The sun was going down and the day was finishing up. We had gotten enough sun, we had already eaten all of our food and even supplemented with a trip down to the snack cart at the opposite end of the beach. It was time to head home. We packed up, we said our goodbyes and we went our separate ways. No long goodbyes, no awkwardness, just a promise that we would have to get together again.
