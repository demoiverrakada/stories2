Still Monday morning just a shift in timing...
"Dude! Look at Dakota McKellen." Toby Mellon tapped his buddy Angus Furlong on the shoulder as they walked from the school parking lot. Seeing her Father Henry dropping the girls and hitchhiker Travis Herbert at the circle drives student drop off she was definitely worth looking at. Angus had a crush on Dakota as it was, even though he was dating cheerleader Robin Banks. "She's pushing boundaries again. Ever since that new Counsellor got to Principal Manley about a new dress code she and Sable have been acting...hotter."
"Nothing wrong with that Bubba." Angus grinned, "Looks like Dakota's still doing it, but Sable's backing down. Why the fuck are they even hanging with Pervert Herbert? Fucking loser!" Angus was not always a nice guy, he had his moments, but the jock in him kept his ego soaring.
As Henry McKellen drives away Dakota looked back for safety and unbuttoned her shirt again, three buttons open her cleavage was spectacular. She wanted to be noticed. Her wish fulfilled over a dozen boys whistled at her. Travis thinking that it was Sable they were howling at flipped them off. A chase ensued leaving the McKellen twins laughing at his sudden bolt toward the school. He was a big pussy to say the least. Sable still found his defending her cute.
"Are you really going to walk around with your tits out?" Sable scowled at her sister.
"They're not out. You can't see my nipples."
"Close enough. You bend over I bet you can."
"Chill out Sable. I know what I'm doing."
"You better. Here comes Angus."
"What? Where? Does my hair look okay?" Dakota freaked out.
"Your hair looks perfect. I'm going to my locker. Don't get into trouble or Mom will kill you."
"I won't." She calmed her nerves as Sable strutted away passing through the turnstile. As Angus and Toby approached her Dakota blushed shyly and fluttered her fingers at them.
"Hey Gorgeous." Angus greeted her, "Love the stretch pants."
"Tight as hell McKellen." Toby chuckled looking at her ass slightly showing from under her shirt's overhang, he could still see the roller coaster ride that her curves sank into. Without underwear on beneath her stretch pants the fabric followed her contours like a second skin, get down to it like her first skin. Save for color she might as well be nude. Tight was an understatement.
"They're comfy." She smiled.
"Hey Bubba?" Angus looked at Toby, "Can I have a minute?" With a nod Toby headed inside the school. "Alone at last." Angus sighed, "Listen, about my asking you out. I understand your worry because of my seeing Robin. It's just taking time killing the relationship, I'm sure you heard about how she mistook Sable for you and got all physical. Good thing that new Counsellor broke it up."
"At least she knows how to break up with someone." Dakota razzes him with her tongue, all while toying with her opened shirt collar daring him to check her out.
"Stop doing that." He laughed.
"Doing what?" She played coy.
"Trying to distract me. I'm trying to be sincere here. I really like you Dakota. I...want...you."
"Want as in?" She quizzed him to see where their true chemistry lie.
"Well, there's that sure...but I want you to be my girl. FIRST!"
"Good answer. I'm open to that but only after you break up with Robin. I just can't commit otherwise, it's not fair to either of us."
"Okay!" He clears his throat and reaches over with both hands to cover her chest by pulling her collar closed. "Are you going to leave this unbuttoned?"
"As long as I can."
"So...this isn't just for me?"
"It is but, I want to feel free. If other boys look so be it. They look at my mom more than they do me. I want to change that."
"Trying to make me jealous?' He chuckled.
"Don't be. I'm just showing off to see how boys react."
"Even in class in front of male Teachers?"
"I'm not sure yet. I might act as if I didn't know my shirt came unbuttoned. I can be a good actress." She bats her lashes. "Mister Dundee is kind of cute." If she only knew Roger Dundee had his sights on Piper Cherry at this very minute. His hands too, she was sitting on his lap in the Teacher's lounge.
"Tease!" He chuckled.
"I'm just getting started. Walk me to my locker?"
He begins to agree when he notices his girlfriend Robin approaching them with her best friend and fellow cheerleader Tina Wiles. Seeing him talking to Dakota she was already sneering, the question was...was she a good actress as well? Last Friday the girls smiled at one another while trying to get Piper Cherry her job, part of a congregated mob outside the Principal's office. Angus while in attendance hadn't seen their shared grin. Was there more than met their eyes?
"There's Robin. I better not so I don't get you into any confrontation."
"Okay! I'll just go tease someone else." She stuck her tongue out at him again then left without looking back. Robin merely sneered until Dakota was out of sight. Hugging Angus, Robin lifted up on her toes and kissed her man good morning. Hands on her ass he wasn't worried about being seen. Once their kiss ended Robin walked away, Tina lingering to blow him a secretive kiss behind his girls back. Yep! He was tapping Tina too.
Dog!
*********
"LET ME GO!!"
Travis Herbert found himself stuffed inside a locker and sealed shut. As his assailants laugh at his confinement Piper Cherry walked downstairs from the second floor of the school. Having just shared in catching Josie McKellen and her Coach Crandell screwing in her classroom before any students arrived she gave them a final moment together and set off exploring again. Finding Sable torn between giggling and worry at the expense of Travis she spotted Piper and ran to her side.
"Some boys locked Travis in a locker. I don't know the combination."
"They still do that?" Piper tried not to laugh, especially after she too had just locked Josie's clothing in another boys locker, how ironic. With a bunch of boys loitering near the locker laughing at the situation Piper patted Sable's shoulder. "I got this sweetie." Sable followed Piper from behind and whimpered at her crushes fate. Brushing her luscious body through the horde of boys, her hands over her head as if saying, "Feel free to grope me." ,Piper made her way through to the closed locker. Snickering Piper knocked on the locker door, "Yoohoo? Anyone home?" The boys all busted up, she was just too cool. Even Sable blushed at her amusement. To Sable's right a boy actually leered her way to peek at her cleavage. Sable bulged her eyes.
"Quit that." She sheepishly reached up to clench her collar together.
"Dakota's was better anyways. She's not wearing a bra."
"Go away Freddie." She nudged the boy aside pouting. As she took a breath Sable unbuttoned one more button. Her sister Dakota was not going to get all of the attention.
"Miss Cherry? Is that you?" Travis wheezed through the tiny air vents, "I can't breath. Clothestraphobic."
"Did you just say clothestraphobic?" She laughed.
"What? No. Get me out of here."
"Relax." She turns with her back to him leaning on the locker with arms folded beneath her chest, her forearms bulging her breasts higher, "Who does this locker belong to?" No one volunteered the information. With more and more students incoming as to what was transpiring Piper noticed an awful lot of big boy sports types. Muscles with roving eyes she thought. Almost forgetting Travis as her mouth watered she was jolted by the locker itself beneath her weight against it. In her hair teasing moment, strands curling around a finger she returns to her priority. "Quiet back there." The kids chuckled.
Twirling her body back to face the locker she bent forward a bit to look at the combination lock as if she could actually know the three digit code. In bending a boy strangely not the jock type grew bold and used a pen to lift her skirt in back until her panties were visible. She didn't notice it or if she did she didn't let on. Finally, Sable swatted the boys hand and ruined it for everyone. It was only a matter of time.
"What's going on here?" Came a familiar masculine voice that made Piper's eyes pop wide. Standing up straight she again turned in step hurriedly, her dress strap dangling over her bicep as it had in the Teacher's lounge.
"Roger?" Piper fanned herself with her fingers as a group of girls joined her. Roger Dundee was a God amongst the female students, crushes from every angle in his well chiseled frame. "Let me guess...Herbert?" He winked at Piper who melted in his unwavering good looks. All she could do was point a nail over her shoulder at the locker and mumble, "Occupied."
"HELP ME MISTER DUNDEE!" Travis babbled.
Looking over his shoulder at the students he sighed, "Who's locker Ladies?" Every girl there pointed at the boy with the big pen, "Is this your locker Brian?"
"Yes Sir." He found himself stressed under the dozen pointing fingernails. While Roger was turned away Piper looked at the girls around him and mouthed, "OH MY GOD!" The girls could not agree more. The jocks around the gathering rolled their eyes as even some of their girlfriends were expressing vibes of yearning fantasies. Even the cheerleaders were looking up at Roger with doe like eyes. Just as he reached over to pull Brian toward him by his shirt Piper slid lower on the locker as if kneeling to blow him. Students cracked up as the second he brought Brian in between he and Piper it looked bad. Brian however grinned up a storm.
"HELL YEAH!" Brian boasted as Piper growled and stood back up pointing at Brian.
"Jockblocker!" She stuck her tongue out at him, even the true jocks laughed hysterically. Shaking his head Roger reached around Brian and grabbed Piper by her wrist and pulled her aside. She followed in a clatter of six inch heels to even more chuckles. Brian unlocked his locker and opened the door letting everyone see Travis scrunched up and pale. Piper feeling badly stepped in being the Counsellor.
"Come here Sweetie." She helped Travis out of his confined space and he dove into her for a hug. Burying his face between her tits he feigned crying. Sable pouted and looked between Piper's chest then down at her own. Without anyone looking she unbuttoned her shirt even more to reveal her own cleavage. Parting her collar for effect she moved beside Piper and rubbed Travis on the back.
"Are you okay Travis?" He mumbled with his face smothered in 38C's, "AH AHM NOHW." Piper smirked at Roger, who couldn't resist looking at her chest as well.
"Get to classes. All of you." Roger clapped his hand then scowled at the lingering Travis, "That's enough hiding out Faker." Tugging his scalp Travis whined at being forced from her breasts.
"Hey! You drooled on me." Piper pointed at saliva puddles on her mounded tits. Roger winked at her then nudged Travis toward Sable, seeing Sable's opened shirt Travis feigned a nervous breakdown and smothered his face into Sable's tits. It made her morning. Piper's turn to grab Travis by his scalp drug him away from Sable and pushed him to go to class. He walked away sniveling and laughing at the same time. Sable gave chase before Piper could stop her over her unbuttoned shirt. As if she would have punished her.
"I warned you. The punks in this place are capable of anything. Hanky?" He offered her his handkerchief from his back pocket.
"Panky maybe. I have my own thanks." Piper lifts her skirt and guides her panties to her heels and lifts one foot out before hiking the other up to bring her the underwear. Using it to dab her chest of saliva she reaches over to Roger and tucks them into his shirt pocket. "Hold on to those for me. No pockets." She twirls in her skirt as he watches it fan up for a sweet visual.
"Damn! Don't let Carl see that. Might be your day for a pink slip."
"I can show you a pink sli-" He puts a finger over her lips to prevent another word.
"Save the T." He knew where she would go if allowed to finish her sentence. "I'll see you later today." Turning away from Roger he took four steps and paused as if to sneeze. Bringing her panties to his nose he used it as if to mask himself. She smelled heavenly. Piper dropped her jaw and smiled as he walked away with her undies draped by one finger over his shoulder.
"Oh, he's good."
********
Hooters Crossing housing division, one street over from Epicenter Court...or as an evil Knox Hardecker referred to it as EpicEnter CUNT with a paint can written on the curb across the street from Piper's home. It was pretty hilarious now that Mace Belmont noticed it as he mowed the yard. He couldn't agree more, there was a lot of epic pussy in the vicinity.
Having finished the McKellen yard first to make a good impression, he began on Piper's. With Henry taking forever to get home he took another sweat break and went out back to strip off and jump in the swimming pool. Swimming one lap just to cool off completely he surfaced on the back side of the pool and lingered there. Hearing a loud feminine scream he paused, "Who was that?" Resting on his arms he listened further, deafening moans riding the airwaves. Looking up at agonizing shrieks he found another set of ears and eyes. Up on his own balcony Knox Hardecker and his buddy Dip were motioning toward the Herbert home. Seeing Mace swimming nude they intended to razz him but the screams ruined their moment.
Mace swam back to retrieve his sweatpants and prowled to the back fence line climbing the fence to peer over to look up at Knox and Dip. "What's going on?"
"The Herbert Hottie!" Dip chuckled, "She's getting her brains fucked out by the bodybuilder."
"The pervert's Mom. Hot ass MILF." Knox puffed on a cigarette dangling from his lips trying to look cool. "Climb over, Dip will go let you in." Unsure if he should, Mace couldn't resist the chance to see Kelly Herbert if he had the opportunity, he had only spotted her once before talking to Travis in his bedroom. She was smoking hot. Knox hated her for joining in on his urination bukkake at the McKellen's, Piper Cherry, and Kelly herself. He had ideas on getting even with all of them, starting with befriending Mace. Be nice Knox. Be nice.
Hurling himself over the fence barefoot in only his sweats Mace walked to the back French doors of the Hardecker home and met Dip. Letting him in Dip led Mace upstairs to his buddie's bedroom. On the walls were posters of every Metal band imaginable, Mace was impressed. What troubled him most was a picture of two sunbathers on his desktop monitor. He knew they were of Dakota and Sable wearing micro bikinis. He had to pause and look. "Daaaamn!"
"If you saw that wouldn't you want pics?" Dip laughed, "Out here." He nodded to join Knox on his balcony. Facing the Herbert home he had easy access to spy directly in on Kelly Herbert's bedroom. High enough for a perfect bedroom scene. With her curtains billowing a tad they could see her Master Dominic Black fucking her silly doggy style, tugging her hair and slapping her ass raw. She was stunning even if she was a ball of succulent sweat. She knew she was being watched but refused to beg her Master to close her blinds. Positive that he would just say, "LET THEM WATCH!" ,she merely bit her tongue.
"Holy crap!" Mace leaned on the rail looking right at her. Knox on his elbows beside him puffing away.
"Only good thing about living next to the pervert." Knox chuckled then waved, "Hey Mrs. Herbert." Dominic heard Knox and tipped his Stetson, the only piece of clothing he wore. Wincing at the trio of voyeurs Dominic growled.
"Lick your lips and beg as if you want those punks." Dom snarled. She obeyed, the boys all mumbling, "Fuck yea!" as she shared a pleading gaze with them. For the following twenty minutes Dom tore Kelly up, the boys enjoying every second of her torture. Mace although liking what he was seeing did feel slightly guilty, especially in seeing Knox recording their sexual destruction on his cell.
"Who's the pervert on this block?" Mace stood up suddenly, "You or her son?"
"Relax Bro. I have tons of footage. Wanna see Kelly hogtied so she can't move?"
"You're watching her too." Dip pointed out, "Takes a perv to befriend a perv. I'm Dip man."
"Hey! I gotta go finish mowing my Aunt's yard."
"The blond bombshell is your Aunt?" Knox winced, "I thought she just liked younger guys. Dude! I've seen her walking naked in front of you."
"You knew I was related in some way. I heard you the other day yell incest is best."
"He's just messing with you Bro." Dip frowned, "We need jams." He then left Knox and Mace to continue observing Kelly, this time performing reverse cowboy riding Dom while facing the boys. Ordered to constantly cry out, "FUCK ME!" , she gave at least Knox a boner. Shockingly, Mace was neutral in that respect. While she was any man's Pornstar dream he just found the domination aspect less appealing.
With music firing up to the sounds of Nine Inch Nail's song Closer it fit the mood. "Fuck you like an animal." Knox sang along gripping his cock for Kelly to witness. The second Knox whipped his pecker out and Dip joined him in a side by side salute of jerking beasts Mace shook his head and waved good bye toward Kelly.
"I'll let myself out." He headed back into the bedroom and stopped to realize the desktop monitor was set to alternate pictures, now seeing Josie McKellen and his Aunt Piper in a 69 frolic within Piper's bedroom. He knew then and there just how close up Knox would have had to have been. Grumbling Mace just let it be. He didn't like Knox Hardecker one little bit. Dip? Questionable.
Deciding not to climb back over the fence Mace chose the Hardecker's front door to just walk around the block. No more than hitting the sidewalk he looked up to see an SUV driving toward him. The driver was Henry McKellen who hadn't noticed Mace yet, frowning at seeing a huge truck in front of Kelly Herbert's home. Not wanting to be questioned Mace bolted through the backyard directly under the balcony to avoid Henry seeing him. As he ran under he felt rain drops on his shoulder and back. Hearing guttural snarls he hissed, "FUCK ME!" It was a hereditary verse amongst the Cherry clan obviously. Not wanting to touch the jizz on his skin he bounded over the fence and dove into the pool to cleanse himself. In his mind it was like adding acid to water.
Back along Quaking Limbs Drive, Henry sat idle looking at Dominic's truck. Having wanted to stop in and check on Kelly he knew it just wasn't the right time. With the music above dissuading him Henry began to drive on home. A shame he couldn't hear Kelly moaning again, he rather liked her soft voice. Screeching his brakes to a halt Henry backed up side by side with Dominic's 4 x 4. giant and hissed. Looking around he put his SUV in park and stepped out. Wincing toward the house he stepped to Dominic's front drivers side tire and unzipped his pants. Dragging out his own pecker he took a much needed piss on the bodybuilder's tire. Yep! Marking his territory.
Back inside his SUV he chuckled and put it into drive. On his stereo the band My Chemical Romance played Thank You for the Venom. It seemed fitting for everyone involved inside and outside the Herbert home. "Why is it I only piss outdoors on this block?" Laughing at a personal victory he went home.
********
Third period at Horton-Dexter.
"OHHHHHHHHHH MYYYYYYYYY GOOOOOOOOOOOD! This is soooooooo booooooooring." Piper Cherry sat at her desk with her face lowered into her folded arms. Kicking her heels off under her desk she remains in hiding as Carl Manley leans on the divider window between their tight office space. Without knowing he was watching she tugged at her hair continuing her verbal depression, "The only good thing about taking this job is Roger Dundee. God I need that man's cock." Amused by her admission he stands there a bit longer.
"Maybe if I get myself off it will keep me from pulling my hair out." She parts her thighs under her desk and reaches between her legs to begin rubbing her clit. "Ohhh that's the ticket. Mmmm! Do you want me?" She envisions Roger in her brain as her eyes remained closed. The image faded quickly.
"What I want is for you to get a grip Cherry."
"I thought you'd never ask Rog..." She found reality in the blink of an eye, eyes that bulge wide and look up to see Carl. "Shit! How long have you been vulturing me Carl?"
"I never said the job wasn't dull." He chose to step in and sit on the edge of her desk. "Please stop touching yourself."
"I don't want to." She pouted and sat back in her seat letting him witness her fingers beneath her skirt.
"I must insist." He smirked.
"Uggggggggggh! Give me something to do already. If you don't I'm just going to bring a toy from home to keep me busy."
"I already gave it to you."
"If you had I'd remember that." She points at his crotch.
"You need to straighten up Piper. I was talking about the files. Familiarize yourself with the students. Plenty to read up on."
"I'd rather observe." She brought her fingers up to her lips and licked her flavor from them right in front of his eyes. "Is it lunchtime yet?"
Shaking his head at her behavior just as a knock landed on the inside wall of Carl's office, he turns to see a familiar face, "Megan? What can we do for you?"
"Sorry to bother you two. Miss Cherry told me to drop by."
"Did she now? Ah, yes, outside I remember." He winced at Piper who grew excitable.
"I did. She was my first friend at Horton-Dexter. We're going to catch up. Shoo Carl go away." Piper stood up and ushered him out. A pat on his bottom made him grimace but hold his tongue. She then motioned Megan inside. "Get in here you."
"Ummm? I brought Dirk." Megan fidgeted. Seeing the boy guided in while groaning, his hands in his pockets Carl puckered.
"I'll leave you to it." Carl Manley took a walk.
"Brought your baggage I see. Come on in. Ummm? Limited seating." Other than her desk chair she only had one other in the compact office. Scooting her chair next to the other one Piper pointed them to choose a chair. Dirk swiftly took the swivel. Piper opted to sit up on her desk in front of them. Both sets of eyes saw her pussy without much effort. Jaws dropped, mostly Megan's. Dirk? He nodded with a smug look. "Okay! So, obviously you must need counselling in the area of chemistry. I can't imagine any other reason."
"Can you...close your legs Miss Cherry." Megan suggested with a pout. She knew Dirk was all in to sin.
"Oh! Sorry!" She pressed her knees together. "Where was I? Besides...well you know...before I..." She clears her throat, "Talk to me guys."
"Megan thinks I'm not giving her enough attention." He rolls his eyes.
"Is that true Mickey?"
"Megan...you knew that." Megan dares to flip her off playfully. "I like you Dirk, I just feel like you don't have time for me. Just look at how you're slobbering over Miss Cherry. You look at other girls more than you do me. Don't think I didn't see you checking out Dakota McKellen's tits earlier. How is she getting away with being able to go with out a bra and her shirt unbuttoned down to her belly button?"
"Wow! I'll have a talk with her later." Piper looked shocked yet in her thoughts, "That's my girl." That meant both of the twins were opening up.
"I couldn't help it." He shrugged, "She's flaunting them. Every guy in school is hoping she flashes nipple."
"Including you." Megan turned away to avoid emotions.
"Listen to me both of you." Piper made them look at her. ,"Dick?"
"Dirk." He rolled his eyes.
"Right you are. Dick?" She persisted making Megan grin, "Do you have feelings for Mickey?"
They gave up reminding her their true names, knowing it was on purpose. Dirk looked over at Megan, "FUCK YES! I love being with her."
"Only because I fuck you. I can say that can't I?" She winces at Piper.
"As open as you want Sweetie."
"Me too?" He asked.
"Of course."
"You have a sweet pussy."
"Aww! This isn't about me. You should be telling Mickey that."
"You have a sweet pussy too." He looks to Megan.
"Oh my god! Dirk...you barely look at it. It's just stick it in, go to town, then kiss me goodbye. You have never once..." She blushes and toys with her glasses. "I don't think you even know how."
"What am I missing?" He looks bewildered.
"Her if you don't give the girl what she wants Dick."
"I give her dick."
"No dumbass..." Piper casts her foot out and plants it over his face pushing him. Megan had to laugh.
"You are soooo awesome." Megan praises Piper.
"Back to business. Dick? Megan wants you to eat her out."
"What?" He turned white.
"Tell him."
"Dirk? I need you to lick me now and then."
"Uhhh? Okay!"
"He has no idea how." Megan shook her head.
"Yes I do."
"Oh? And, who have you eaten out?"
"Wait! What? No one. I've only been with you I swear." Panic mode brought on honesty.
"Whatever Dirk." Megan felt like leaving until Piper put her other foot in her face this time.
"Sit!" Piper then stood up and wiggled out through Carl's office and snatched up a post-it note using a pen on his desk to write, "DO NOT DISTURB!!" then stuck it above the doorknob and sealing the door. The couple looked puzzled. Returning to them Piper coaxed Megan to stand. "Eighteen right?"
"Yes." Both nodded perplexed.
"Pants down." She encourages Megan who turned blood red in the face. "Do it." Megan whined and just did it, pants and panties to her ankles. "Sit on my desk."
Wheezing she hopped up and sat there trembling knowing exactly what was going to happen. Piper turning her attention to a mind blown Dirk, "Show her you know what you're doing."
"Seriously? Isn't this sexual harassment?"
"Probably! When will you ever be able to brag about doing this in the Principal's office? Well, close enough."
"He is NOT going to do any bragging I'll swear he's lying." Megan defended her.
"Dig in." Piper leaned on the divider just as Carl had earlier.
"He won't." Megan starts to climb off when Dirk jumps to his feet and grabs Megan's knees. Shocked by his sudden movement Megan looks at Piper with fear.
"Relax. I'll even turn my back and give you two privacy."
"NO! Don't leave me." Megan grew nervous.
"You said he never eats you out. I'm picking up vibes that you yourself have never been eaten out."
"And, you're giving me hell?" Dirk paused to explore Megan's face.
"I want to though." She whimpered and thrashed her legs under the cuffing of her pants at her ankles. Pretty good bondage get down to it. Eying Megan's adorable pink pussy with a tad more pubic hair than necessary, Dirk leans in nervously and dabs his tongue on her labia. She tensed with each sample finding sensitivity. Each time she gasped Dirk grinned and did it again to taunt her. Finally, he just went for it. It was when his tongue grazed her clit that Megan yelped and arched her back. "Right there Dirk." She begged.
Taking direction he did his time down there until her moans were getting a bit too loud for even Piper's comfort zone, this being Carl's domain. Scooting around Dirk, Piper leaned over Megan and petted her hair for comfort. Holding her breath Megan tried her best to refrain from being any louder. As Dirk took it upon himself to add a finger up inside Megan the girl lost it. "YES YES YES!"
Dirk hitting pay dirt just smiled at Piper and finger fucked Megan as he gnawed on her clit. At a volume too high Piper cupped the girls mouth and muffled her, "Sorry Sweetie." She understood and seconds later squirted all across Dirk's face, drowning his t-shirt. Even her jeans below were drowned in her juices. Panting heavily Megan found Piper easing her palm away and smiling at them.
"This never happened." She insisted pointing at both of them. Nodding their confirmation Dirk actually helped Megan pull her pants up and stood back to let her zip up, her soggy panties tightening up inside her cameltoe. A tender hug between the couple made Piper sigh. As they pulled away from one another both of them hugged Piper.
"Keep doing what you're doing Dick. Now I give you permission to sneak in a cigarette." Piper snickered, "I think she needs one too." Walking them to the door Piper paused them to look outside first. The bell ringing startled her but yet she waved them out to merge with the other students transitioning toward fourth period classes.
Leaning on the door observing students going by she spots Sable McKellen waving at her. Noticing her shirt unbuttoned and her own bra removed Piper peaked an eyebrow, "Well now! Someone's getting braver." Venturing toward her Piper now located Dakota surrounded by girls giggling along with her, making new friends it looked like. Stepping from a classroom without looking where he was going Principal Carl Manley cut off Dakota and fumbled in apologizing to the girl, her friends holding their oxygen at Dakota being seen. Holding her shoulders Carl looked straight down at Dakota's opened shirt to see twin peaks all the way down to her tummy. Clearing his throat he just looked up and let it go.
Jaws were dropped. So were Dakota's chemistry notes.
Kneeling to pick up her book and papers Angus Furlong swooped in for the save. Dropping down to assist her he got a solid look at her full breasts now that her shirt fanned out more. She blushed looking up at him. He kept cool and helped her to her feet.
"Thank you."
"No...thank you." He winked. "See you later."
Stunned by his being somewhat the gentleman Dakota fluttered her fingers at his swagger. Off he went. Her friends Andi and Sandy in awe just swarmed her giggling. Piper had to smile. Another glance toward Sable she saw the jealousy brewing inside her and even intentionally dropped her own books to see if boys would look down her shirt. Not a one noticed. Seeing disappointment in the girl Piper reached out to a jock going by and pointed at Sable. Seeing her tits dangling the boy bolted to her side and offered his help. Sable was now beaming.
"Saved by the Belle." Piper smirked. "I think I'm getting good at this."
Carl approaching Piper eased beside her to examine the chaos. "You just had to disrupt the dress code didn't you?"
"Don't you dare renege on that." She tapped his chest with a nail.
"This isn't Wednesday. My plan was only to let the dress code lapse on Wednesday's."
"Just go with it."
"Josie's girls are getting a bit too..."
"I'll have a chat with them. You just go grumble."
He growled at his new Counsellor and discovered the Post-It note over the doorknob still. Reading it he chuckled and put the note eye level on the door to show he had moved it. He then pushed her out and shut the door locking it. Turning in shock she saw the note.
"I can live with that."
She did not disturb him the remainder of the day.
"Shoot! My heels are in there."
Barefoot it was.
