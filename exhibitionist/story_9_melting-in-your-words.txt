All characters are over the age of 18. The characters and events present are created from my own overactive imagination and any resemblance to anyone is accidental. This story was created as a submission for the VALENTINES DAY 2021 competition. It has romantic love and is also my love letter to romantic and erotic literature. I look forward to seeing your responses in the comments. I hope you rate it highly and favourite it. I may write a sequel if there is interest.
23/02/21 Edit -- I have added in the name of the narrator for each section, whenever it changes. For first time readers the dual perspective has been causing confusion and I don't believe it is too disruptive to add the name (although the POV switches occur often during the ending). Thank you for reading and I hope this addition makes reading this story a smoother experience!

Ellie
It was a modern library I sat inside, sheltering from the darkness and the cold. The university had spent an extortionate amount building a new library that was ready to use as I was entering my first year. I had mixed feelings about it. On the one hand it was a beautiful and elegant modern building. Glass and panelling all the way up its exterior, multiple floors, walkways inside that circled around an open area, and more books than you could ever read.
Still, I had previously visited the old library a few times for the books that hadn't been transferred over and each time I went I felt a little melancholy that it was being replaced and made irrelevant. The old library was a big ancient brick building with tight twisting passages and books haphazardly shelved. Little cosy nooks and crannies that you felt rewarded for finding. It had a lot of character. A place like that seemed like it would suit me. What's more, there was a cute tabby cat that often lounged on the wall outside and was very willing to be petted when I walked past. He liked belly rubs and tickles behind the ears, in case you needed to know.
I could not imagine my feline friend acting that comfortable on the concrete outside the new library. Undoubtedly, both he and I had yet to find a place we could truly relax when it came to this modern library. Perhaps that was why I was struggling to work?
I banged my forehead on the hard table. Aiming to dramatically lay my head on it like a scene from a movie, I had succeeded only in making a loud "thud" noise and likely denting my forehead.
My little piece of performance was only for myself. No one was around to witness it. I had thought that acting out my frustration physically would help. It appeared it wouldn't be that easy.
The world looked odd from my horizontal viewpoint. I could see my laptop through the strands of hair that fell over my face but my gaze rapidly grew unfocused and I found myself staring out towards the bookshelves. They were blurry and difficult to see from this unusual angle. Suddenly feeling embarrassed by my public melodrama I quickly straightened myself up, smoothed out my jumper and skirt and brushed my hair back into place behind my ears. Returning my gaze to my laptop, the intimidatingly dense paragraphs of scruffy and uninteresting writing that greeted me almost encouraged me to return to sulking once more.
I really was struggling to make headway. Why was it taking so long to write a scene? I had done many one-shot scenes and short stories before, had I wrestled with those the same way? Romance novels were a new genre for me true enough, and I lacked useable experience, but as a first year we we're expected to go attempt multiple genres instead of going deep into any single topic like we would in later years when creating a manuscript. I suppose the university wanted all English Literature and Creative Writing students to experiment before settling into any particular genre. Experience is key after all.
I suppose my lack of experience really hurt me when it came to writing romance.
I was definitely someone who fitted into the typical "shy bookish" character. It was how I had grown up. Books and indoor activities were encouraged and I never really desired engaging in team sports.
Most of my life had centred around keeping quiet during class and doing the work, socialising with a few close friends I felt safe with, a quick burst of energy and freedom at badminton club before returning home to whatever quiet and introverted hobby was the focus at the time. That hobby was often, although not always, reading.
I think my family believed that I would change when I arrived at university. My mum definitely hoped I would gain some maturity, as she thought I was holding myself back from entering the "adult world", but so far their prayers had been unanswered. I was a bookish introvert and that was fine. Why leave what you knew?
I hadn't joined any societies and pushed myself out of my comfort zone and I certainly wasn't one to start a relationship. I had partied and clubbed a bit but soon found it not entirely to my liking, at least staying out all night and getting horrible drunk. Dancing and partying wasn't the worst thing in the world though. At least I could have fun without struggling to make my way through a conversation.
I suppose it is ironic, my inability to speak, given my name.
Oh yes, I'm sure Ellie doesn't sound like it has any ironic connotations. What does the shortened version of the name Eleanor have to do with speaking? Nothing. But my name isn't short for Eleanor, my parents aren't that normal. No, I am named Eloquence...yep. Ellie short for Eloquence. How pretentious does that make me sound?
Thinking about having to introduce myself to people that way made me cringe in my seat. As I did I realised I had daydreamed about the reasons I wasn't writing for far too long. That was how I was. I really did like to go on tangents. I guess that was just something I had always-
"Ahem."
I was about to let my thoughts stray onto another tangent, as usual. It likely would have lasted a long time, and led onto another. After hours of introspection mixed with brief periods of staring at a screen I would have left the library, frustrated with my lack of progress. In the darkness I would have trudged back home to my student accommodation, deciding to give it a rest for today. Progress on my short romance scene would have halted, for now and who knows when it would have picked up again.
As it happened, I was not destined to do any more creative writing that day regardless, but because of a very different distraction.
Standing over me, politely clearing her throat, was a tall, dark haired girl. Should I say woman? Well, she didn't seem older than me by much, so I was hesitant to add her to such a category. Actually, as a university first year, could I not be classified as a woman myself? Still she did seem far more mature.
Cool office attire clad her obviously curvaceous figure. Heels, tights, black pencil skirt, and a beautifully fitting white blouse. It may have been predictable, maybe even clich√©, female office attire but on her attractive form and compared to the frumpy and comfy look of the older librarians, she stood out.
I could tell she was a librarian from the stack of books she carried both in her arms and on a metal trolly. A lanyard and nametag hung from her neck and identified her as Aristeia. A beautiful name for a stunningly attractive and mature looking librarian. A librarian, no woman -- she deserved that title with respect -- who was currently clearing her throat to gain my attention.
I pulled out my earbuds to make it clear I was listening but they had not been playing music for some time.
"Uh, hello?" Was my fantastic first line.
"Hi there, sorry to bother you it's just that I could see that you seem to be struggling. You're experimenting with romance like the other first years, right? The single scene challenge?"
She was right, so I blustered a hurried "yes" and a nod in response. It was a yearly module so it made sense she would know if she was older than me, and it was possible she had seen the multiple online articles about how to write in the genre that I had been pulling up on my screen.
She smiled, "Well have you read 'Writing Love: 101 Ways to Be Romantic'? It's quite a good overview and it goes into some great ways to plot your story beats and do descriptions. Also..." She started, adding a conspiratorial whisper and leaning towards me, "not many first years take a look at it so it marks you out as going beyond the reading standard list if you use its techniques. I've just had this copy returned and processed so I'm on my way to put it back on the shelf but perhaps you'd like to borrow it instead?"
Saying this she separated a book from the bottom of her pile and held it out.
I hadn't read the book she had mentioned, so I shook my head in answer to her first question but then I realised I should actually be thanking her for her more recent offer. Did shaking my head seem like I was refusing? I hurriedly took the book from her outstretched hand without really looking at it before saying "thank you" emphatically.
I was getting flustered. I could feel it. Was it just having such a sudden conversation? I felt unprepared and my heart was pounding looking up at this woman.
I let out a little breath and allowed myself to calm down. Her gesture was a nice one so I should take the effort to respond to her properly.
"I was definitely struggling to find good sources so thank you for this!" I said tapping the book, now clasping it between both hands.
She readjusted her grip to help hold the rest of her stack of books and smiled back.
"The pleasure is mine. It's my job so I can hardly resist the urge to help out. I'm not able to recommend too many books outside my area of study, but I did English Lit and Creative Writing for my undergrad and I'm doing my MA in Literary Studies so feel free to ask if you need a hand anytime."
"I certainly will A-Ariste-ia." I said, pointedly looking at her nametag, just so she knew it was the first time I was learning her name.
"Please, call me Ari. I think my parents were having a bit of a joke when it came to my name." She said laughing. Laughing in a way I had never done about my own name.
"I-I'm Ellie...um...short for Eloquence. -probably the same joke as yours." I said, cringing and physically wincing about how horrible it sounded out loud.
"Short for Eloquence? Really?" Oh god I wanted to shrivel up. "That's a very pretty name." Huh?
I looked at her surprised.
"I've never heard someone named that before so you'll definitely stick in my mind." She replied, grinning.
"Come over to the front desk when you want to take the book out. It's pretty dense so you might not get through all of it tonight...And I guess since I'm giving it to you, you don't know where it came from to put it back." She added as an afterthought to herself. She really was quite confident and mature. Not in an overly outgoing way but she could handle herself easily. Despite it seeming that she was only two or three years older than I was, labelling her as a "woman" and still considering myself a "girl" certainly did seem to fit in my mind.
Her job done she said a quick "see you later", which I returned, and then went off with her stack of books and trolley. I watched her glide over to the glass barrier that overlooked the entrance. For a moment she was framed on either side by bookshelves and with the opposing walls providing a white and distant backdrop. Her eyes flicked back in my direction for a brief fraction of a second before turning the corner and disappearing behind shelves, heading in the direction of the lifts.
I smiled to myself at the thought that she would be waiting for me at the counter when I left later tonight. That thought was a pleasant one but my happiness at the possibility did cause a slight blush to work its way up my neck. Trying to ignore it I turned back to the book she had given me, ready to get to work.
However, as I have already mentioned, I would not actually resume research on how to write romance that day. As much as I had planned to.
No, I would not study the construction of romance novels in those late hours to progress my ability to write. I would not expand my skillset, although I suppose I would end up expanding my knowledge.
The book that greeted me was not the one I had expected. 'Writing Love' did not greet me. There were not hundreds of tips on how to construct romance, nor any great insight on the genre conventions inside this book. My eyes went wide at the cover, and the blush that had been kept on my neck since meeting Aristeia suddenly rushed to overflowing my face.
This books... this book was!
***
Ari
Fuck! Oh fuck, I'd messed up. Oh shit this was really bad! She was kind of cute looking all tired out but hard working so I had made a mistake. Oh god Ari, what have you done?
I sat at the library counter staring at 'Writing Love: 100 Ways to Be Romantic'. I was turning it over and over in my hands as if doing so would magically change it into another book and my panic would have all been caused by a trick of the light.
Having retreated to my desk after noticing one particular book was missing the rest of the stack of books now lay in a messy pile next to me. Even as I had searched through them I knew the whereabouts of the one I was missing. It was sods law. If I was going to accidentally give her any book, it was going to be that book. The one I had kept hidden at the bottom of the pile, where my arm could hide the name upon it's spine while I carried it.
Currently, that first year, was sitting in a library after having just been handed a book titled 'Dripping Words', a lesbian erotic romance...that I'd fucking "recommended"!
Oh my god!
She would know I had made a mistake, right? We'd discussed what the correct book was so she wouldn't think that I'd purposefully given her an erotica, right? Unless she thought all of that was some elaborate cover for giving her the book she'd ended up with. Would she think that I was hitting on her in a roundabout way?
I scratched my head vigorously and messed up my hair. What was until a few moments ago straight presentable hair, was now the intensely frizzy mess of a mad woman. I rushed to get my brush out to repair the damage, as if brushing my hair would ease both my messed up style and the problem of the misplaced book.
After I'd noticed my mistake and searching through my pile I had headed back to her seat twice but the first time she was missing and by the second visit other students had arrived around her. At that time she had been reading intently. Probably reading a book that would actually help her with her writing and attempting to drown out the embarrassing situation I had put her in.
Because she had seemingly gotten back to work and the awkwardness of having a conversation about a missing erotic book around others, I hadn't had a chance to apologise and correct my mistake. Instead I simply had to sit and let my brain fizzle in embarrassment.
You wouldn't expect a university library to have "smut" in its collection but due to our large and thriving literature department we had plenty of fiction of all types on the shelves. Erotica was one of the smaller sections within that, necessary for some modules from a very adamant professor, or so I'd heard. Professor Karl-something I think? I'd never taken a module for him personally and I'd never borrowed them for my own use. The erotic books were rarely borrowed and I blushingly restocked them as quick as I could when they were returned.
...Not out of embarrassment for the content inside, I should add. I am perhaps, well acquainted with that type of literature, you might say. Ah who am I kidding. I read a lot of it. Which isn't unusual for women might I add! Romance and erotica are mostly read by women! The statistics say so. Still, evidently, I feel the need to justify my interest...
I'd never borrow any erotica from the university library, of course. Borrowed books can be seen by the people who work here let alone when you physically walked around with them. It was mostly digital for me. Regardless, many of the titles we had in stock were familiar to me. The "Dripping Words" series was certainly familiar to me.
I'll admit the title felt a bit too on the nose for me. It advertised too overtly that its content was sexual. I like to be teased with a title. I mean sure Dripping words fit a series about two women slowly developing a romance over sharing feedback on novels they are writing. But there are better options, right? Why not, 'The Power of Pens', or 'Literary Bonds' or 'Connected Words'?
Wow, all of those sounded really generic, didn't they? Okay... not my best I'll give you that. I dunno, I just thought there were possibilities there yet unexplored.
Title aside the series was pretty good. Not a favourite or anything but still, a good work. The first book was exciting and I still was amazed at how the sequels remained entertaining even after the main pair hooked up and answered the "will they, won't they" question. The sex scenes were pretty hot...that bookshop scene...hmm...
I shook myself, most likely messing up my hair again. Eugh, now is not the time to reminisce about that series when its first entry is currently in the possession of a probably quite embarrassed first year. I sighed deeply.
I had likely ruined my chances of a friendship with that girl and failed in my attempt to academically help her. She would quietly return the book to the shelf using its reference number (oh god had I inadvertently forced her to take a trip to the erotica section?) and then use a self-service machine to scan and borrow her actual useful book.
Oh well, my shift would be over in two hours. Luckily I didn't have to do an overnight shift so I could still study tomorrow. My embarrassment would fade and life would be back to normal soon.
Or so I had thought, before I heard a very quiet and uncertain"Ahem."
I looked up. It was her!
"It's you!" Wow, real smooth Ari. "Um- oh, Eloquence wasn't it?" She visibly cringed, oh god, she really was embarrassed. Had she simply chosen handing the book back to me the lesser of two evils when compared to going to the erotica section?
"Um...yes. Um could you call me- Would you mind- No never mind..." She seemed about to say something then made the decision not to mid-sentence. A thought flickered to my mind.
"Oh! You introduced yourself as Ellie right? Sorry, if you want to be called that of course I will. Eloquence is just so memorable." Eesh. What an awkward recovery. Still it seemed to gain a good response from her.
She straightened her body in something near pride as I acknowledged her chosen name and then curled up again embarrassed as I complimented her name. What a meddlesome, if entertaining, reaction. I decided to plough forward, even at the risk of embarrassing her. I had to make things clear.
"Listen," I moved closer with a whisper even though there was no one in the main lobby area, "I'm so sorry about that book. I meant to recommend the one I told you about, this one! That other book was just one I was returning to the shelf. I'm sorry that it probably embarrassed you, and likely was no help for your creative writing." I added as an afterthought.
She blushed in response as Dripping Words was brought up and eyed me warily but gradually as I finished my explanation she calmed down. This really wasn't the impression I'd been hoping to make but at least I had cleared things up.
She forced a laugh out unnecessarily in response and I watched as her eyes flicked all around the lobby, only occasionally flicking to me.
"..Yeah...I ah -- I could tell. I guessed. I mean -- just looking at the cover. But -- it's fine I just -- carried on with other books I had." Her eyes flicked down to her arms holding only Dripping Words, "I mean online sources!"
Her face looked flushed as she spoke and I could feel her rising embarrassment. She was not used to the type of novel she currently held onto. Which did make me wonder why she had not put it down quicker.
"Could I get -- I mean borrow the other one now? For my writing. The one you meant?" She continued. I wasn't sure whether to be embarrassed for her or amused at the display.
"Sure you can," I answered and started checking out her book and preparing for her to swipe her student ID which doubled up as a library card.
"I take it you want to hand back that one too?" I said, gesturing at Dripping Words still held tightly in her arms. Was she scared of others seeing her holding it and was trying to hide it?
She looked surprised that she still had it with her and hurriedly passed it over to me, stumbling over her words as she agreed.
"Yes. Right! Better do. No need for it anymore. I mean at all. Like -- It wasn't the one I needed. For my writing."
Her way of speaking really was humorous I decided.
I put it back in my pile of books to shelve as she continued to speak. I didn't run it through the system as a book she had borrowed however, no need really. It was my fault. She didn't need a book like that on her record because of my accident.
She watched Dripping Words disappear under the other books and her shoulders finally dropped, like she couldn't relax until it was out of sight and hidden from view, before her eyes nervously returning to me.
"All done!" I said, passing her Writing Love. 101 ways to...whatever. The one I'd recommended. It hardly seemed important anymore but at least it meant I had finally completed my task, properly this time. Better late and post-embarrassment, than never.
"Any other books you'd like to return or borrow?" I asked, remembering she'd been reading another book when I'd wanted to apologise.
"N-No thanks! All the books I have been using have been online. Yes. Aside from this one." She replied, patting Writing Love and sliding it into the pink backpack slung across her shoulder.
"All good then!" I replied. She must have finished and returned that book to its shelf before she came here, or she'd found that it wasn't useful. She had seemed to be reading it intently though. Whatever the case, I was glad that me handing her Dripping Words hadn't completely damaged her progress with her assignment and that despite her obvious embarrassment she was able to continue.
She seemed reluctant to leave, as if she had more to say but if she did, she never shared it with me. She straightened herself out, said goodbye and walked to the door, leaving me staring after her.

Ellie
I couldn't believe it. It was a shock to see such a thing. To be handed it. I'd never come into contact with such a book. Was I sheltered perhaps? Was it normal to have seen those books in your life? So much time spent indulging in solitary hobbies yet I'd never explored such books before.
This couldn't have been what she meant to give me, right? She had mentioned that other book, The writing tips book, so this was a mistake, right? She had had an armful of books and she'd made a mistake. That was all it was. She'd probably realise her mistake soon. If she did she'd be expecting me to hand it back in to her right away. That was what everyone would do. That was what anyone would do when handed this kind of...dirty...book.
Except...I didn't.
I couldn't help it. It was a book. I'm curious. I love reading. So...I...read.
And read.
And read.
And turned page after page. Eyes racing over the lines as they flowed from cover to cover. Following the twists and turns or rather, being carried by the waves that the words formed. I got caught in the swell as it rose and washed me violently away from the dry land I was comfortable with. My head barely staying above the surface as I read and I many times forgot to take those necessary breaths, ignoring the need for air. It was all encompassing.
I had read it all before I even realised I had started.
I lost awareness of my surroundings. I didn't notice the people who had sat around me. That was definitely embarrassing. For people to see me so engrossed in such a book while my university work sat disregarded.
While I read, I didn't notice my response to Dripping Words. Well, I didn't keep track of it at least.
Maybe it was only after I had finished reading that my body had reacted? Yeah.
Maybe.
Maybe it was only when I became aware of my surroundings once again that my heart had started pounding in my chest? It's possible. It's possible that my breathing only started coming in pants as I put that book down. Right? It's possible that...that the evidence of the book's effect on me, it's stimulation of me, only happened just as I became aware of it...
No. I knew the book had affected me before then.
Sadly I know and will always know that it was not the ending scene that had caused my response. Oh it was wonderful to see those characters start their relationship sure. But it was not that ending scene that had caused my heart to jackhammer, my chest to tighten, and...my legs to squeeze together. It was those other scenes, the earlier ones, the passionate ones.
I don't know if anyone noticed how I looked while reading. I don't know if anyone recognised the book I was reading. I have no clue if anyone put it all together. Even without knowing that I fled. I rushed from my desk, rushed to...to the bathroom, face flushed and sweat running down my face and chest.
There are people who are far more experienced with -- arousal -- than I am. It's possible they could recognise the fire in my eyes, and the way I was melting in its heat.
When I had made it to the bathroom...it was something else. I didn't even make it into a stall. I barely looked around to check that I was alone before I was leaning against the sinks. A long solid counter ran along the side of this bathroom, sinks embedded inside it. It was sturdy, and I could lean against it. Marble, or something cheaper? I didn't know. I wasn't paying that much attention. My jumper had shifted and risen so that my stomach rested against the counter, so cool against the inferno of my skin.
One hand disappeared up my jumper and pulled down my bra. My breasts were vulnerable to my grasping hand and my nipples stretched out towards my pinching fingers. The bathroom echoed with my gasp and I bit my lip to prevent more escaping.
It didn't work.
What I was left with was stifled rumbles deep in my throat. With air unable to escape as I bit my lip and forced my mouth shut, the sounds I was making were deep and resounded inside my own head. Low, throaty moans. I shut my eyes as if some act of synaesthesia would block out the sound as well as my sight.
Closing my eyes also prevented me from acknowledging where my other hand was moving towards until it reached it. Closed eyes locked me in my own world, as if I was not responsible for the actions of my limbs or the reaction of my body.
My thighs flinched as a hand touched them. The sensation on my fingertips, reminding me that it was my own hand doing such an act. My fingers were warm, but so were my thighs, the contrast was not great. The cool sweat running along them under my skirt was what truly contrasted.
My wandering fingers quickly homed in on the corners of the fabric that lay underneath my skirt. They hesitated for only a second before I urged them onwards. Under, and forwards.
Two fingers went either side of my lips and stroked along them, teasing them into responding. More sounds welled up in my mouth. I sought out the nub, my clit. It jumped and sent shivers throughout my body. My eyes shot open as I rubbed and my eyes locked with another pair.
It took me a few seconds to figure out they were my own brown eyes staring back at me, reflected in the wall mirror. They looked different. My whole face did. It was red, and not my usual embarrassment red. It was some red of...need? Longing? Desperation?
My eye makeup was smudged, it made the edges of my eyes look like they were vanishing. Blending in with the rest of my face. My biting had moved my lips into unnatural and mismatched angles. Sweat was rolling down my forehead as my mind overheated. I truly was melting. Soon I'd be a puddle, dripping onto the floor.
Still, it was not enough. The angle was all wrong. I needed better.
I spun around and sat on the counter. My hand withdrew from under my skirt and dived into my knickers from above. Better, so much better.
All my fingers now had access. My hand rubbed back and forth and three fingers at a time stimulated my clit. I pushed and pulled my clit and moved my lips around, drawing circles with my fingers. The effect built up rapidly.
My head started lolling from side to side as if staying still had become unbearable. Breaths came powerfully and suddenly, and my chest dropped heavily as pleasure forced air out of me. Who needed to breathe when something this incredible seemed not to need it?
My eyes shut once again and as they did my mind recalled scenes. Scenes from the story. That book, it had started it all and that book was going to carry me over the edge. A mirage of experiences I had never had but now could clearly imagine washed over me. Positions, settings, activities. Things I had only known to be factual possibilities, pleasures reserved for others, I now imagined myself enjoying.
The hand that had been touching my chest withdrew and dived underneath my leg, lifting it so it could access my lips from the bottom. Soon my middle finger was pushing inside of me, matching the pace of my other hand as it rubbed.
A guttural moan finally burst forth. I heard it echo throughout the bathroom. Tiles threw my noise back at me. Soon I was over the edge. My head rolled forwards and backwards, my back did the same and I felt my body clench and release. I pushed harder, extending the pleasure that was coursing through me. Words from that book flowed over my mind, things I dare not say out loud were suddenly screaming inside my mind.
My hips rose and fell as if upon a ship and soon my head swung upwards and let my mouth release a long sigh. I sat there with my eyelids fluttering and felt the corners of my mouth move. A smile grew upon my face, my cheeks forced to bend to its shape and happiness flowed through me. A quiet, shaky laugh dropped out of my open mouth. An involuntary response, joy was leaking from me in all forms. Unable to remain within me, the overflow was escaping, running off the counter and onto the floor.
My eyes blinked and gradually, white tiles came back into view. It took me quite a while to move, and even longer to move steadily. When I did, I caught something in the mirror.
The face of the woman reflected back at me was different to the one I usually saw. It took me washing my face and redoing my makeup for me to recognise some part of my own visage in it. Even then, there was something about the girl that I saw in the mirror that day, that seemed just a bit, older.
***
That day, I had practically stumbled out of the bathroom. I constantly felt the eyes of others on me as I returned to my seat, even more so when I realised that book was still there, waiting for me. It felt like it was smiling at me, knowingly.
Sitting in the library now, even a couple weeks after the event, I could again feel my face burning at the memory. That had happened often since then. I couldn't get it out of my mind. That book, what I'd read...what I'd done. The woman at the library. That woman in the mirror.
Ari hadn't meant to give it to me. I was unsure at first but she made it clear at the front desk and I had no reason to doubt her. She seemed honest. It had been an accident on her part and she likely expected that I had instantly realised and then ignored the novel she had given me. Except I hadn't. That was why I was so embarrassed when it came to handing the book back and getting that one she recommended. I hadn't done what I was supposed to.
The book she had recommended was very useful. No doubt on that front. It did help my understanding of what I was supposed to write. Still, it had come at a price.
Throughout my lectures and seminars I was distracted. The topic of romance novels came up often and with my scene still requiring attention I could not escape topics that linked back to that day in the library. That day when my world had been opened up.
My work was suffering, I knew that. My analysis of literature was tinged, coloured in a way it had never been before because something I was never truly conscious of now filled my mind. It altered my reception of works so I dared not express my unfiltered, uncensored responses. I cut back and withheld my thoughts. I couldn't bring myself to say what I had truly interpreted so when asked for my analysis of works I was clumsy, uncoordinated and incoherent. It was just too embarrassing to speak of one thing when your mind was screaming that something else was present.
And I was likely wrong wasn't I? There was no way I could be right! There was no way that so much of fiction related to...sex.
But that was what was on my mind. At all times. Passion, lust... sex, in literary form. That book.
My creative writing practice had become affected too. I had been practicing writing small pieces for a long time, especially since I entered university. If I wished to become an author, and that was one path I considered going down, I ought to get some experience. Still, since reading that book, things had changed.
My topics dipped towards feelings in a way I never had before. They didn't really mirror the blush-inducing events of Dripping Words, but the way I felt myself describing the sensations my characters experienced had a physicality to it I had never experienced. And I couldn't deny that I felt my attempts to continue writing on the topic of romance were skirting around the edge of what Dripping Words featured.
I couldn't go any closer towards it than I was. It would be too embarrassing to write such things. Regardless I could sense that shying away from the topics that were bursting forth was stifling my writing. Each scene I attempted to write, felt like it stopped when there was more to say. I was unable to write more because I was desperately holding myself back. I knew if I unlocked that door, I would write and write and write.
This was just too confusing. No way to write academically without thinking of...it. And no way to write my fiction without brushing shoulders with the topic that was so distracting me.
I huffed. There was something I could do. A way to solve the issue, at least from one angle. There was something that creative writing and literary analysis had taught me. There was advice you were always given. 'If there is an itch, you ought to scratch it. If there was a theme you wished to explore, explore it, write it, investigate it'. This would be the same right? In a way...
I'd just be indulging my curiosity. Nothing wrong with that.
I saved my work, switched off my laptop and stood up. I packed up quickly. It was funny how quickly you could move when walking away from work.
I headed off. I knew where it would be.
I had seen the code on the book's spine and the back cover told me there were sequels. I just had to find them. Find them and disappear. Hide away so that no one would know. And so that no one would interrupt.
I found the correct floor quickly. I saw the letter indicating the aisle I needed to turn down and rushed round the corner. The numbers stretched out before me, it would likely be somewhere down the end. I paused for a second. The aisle seemed imposing, the books too colourful whilst also soaked in darkness. The lights overhead were spaced out every five aisles. Their light reached their neighbours, but missed every third aisle. Like this one.
The books were fiction. Modern fiction with colourful, expressive and eye catching covers. A far cry from the bland analytical research that adorned most of the shelves in the library. The aisle stood out as its own little world.
I pushed forward, deeper into it. My hand ran along the middle shelf tracing the letters, even though I didn't know if it would be on that shelf, or even this side with the way the numbers doubled back on themselves on the opposing shelf.
Ah! Too far. I'd gone past it.
I moved back a few steps but the bottom shelf on the previous rack was too early, albeit only by a few numbers. It was high up on the next one. It had to be.
I spotted it because I recognised its neighbour. I'd already seen that cover before. I stretched up and rested my grip over Dripping Words as if it was an old favourite. My hand already knew the size of the spine. The bond between us had grown rapidly. I pulled my fingers off it and moved one space over. I gripped, and pulled it down.
It sat there in my hands. Drenched Letters.
The naming motif of this series was easy to establish.
I hurriedly scanned the book at the self-service till with a pile of research books I needed. Thank goodness the machine could scan multiple at a time and I could hide it amongst them.
Now to find a concealed corner. I knew a place, on the fourth floor.
The nice rounded booth greeted me. It had a small entryway, two long, red, cheap leather covered benches, with very high backs and a long table in the middle, separating the two sides.
Enclosed. Comfortable. Intimate.
If I laid on one of the benches I could rest my back against the side next to the entrance and be hidden from view unless someone stepped into the booth itself. So that was where I settled down. This did mean that I had no chance of seeing anyone approaching but, considering what I was reading and planning to do. I doubted I would looked up anyway.
This time, I didn't wait till I finished reading.
I think I got twenty pages in before I unbuttoned my shorts. Twenty-one was when my fingers slipped underneath my knickers. From then on I read so fast it would have been hard to pin down the precise page when things happened. What I do know is...I had two.
The first almost shocked me out of it. I nearly stopped what I was doing. It rushed upon me so fast I hadn't realised how far I'd built up my - my pleasure. My body shook and my hips slid back and forth on the bench. My shorts were at my thighs by this point and so the smooth material underneath me rubbed against my behind.
All at once I became aware that I was being so obvious. If anyone were to look in there could be no mistake, I'd be caught. Shorts down and fingers busy. No way to get out of that.
I suppose it is one of the curiosities about myself, ones I am only beginning to understand, that is the reason that the idea of getting caught did not prevent me from continuing. It only encouraged me to place my jacket over my waist. It would do little to conceal my activity, but it would give me a chance to deny it.
The voice that told me to stop was so small. The voice that told me to be careful was slightly louder. The voice that told me "more" screamed.
The second came a long time after the first. I was enjoying it, the act of playing. Just that. I wasn't working towards anything, I was just enjoying the intensity of the stimulation. I was just enjoying reading while my wet fingers slid in and out. It was wonderful.
Eventually however, it seemed I could not hold out, and I crashed over the edge somewhere around the third sex scene after the conference scene. It was a good scene.
I finished the book that day. I didn't orgasm a third time but I continued to lazily touch myself as I read and before I knew it, it was over. I had read it all. Well, all of that book. It was a series of six after all.
I knew that I had to borrow the third in the series quickly. I needed to read it! At the back of my mind there was a nagging sensation that something was wrong but I put it aside.
I rushed to slide Drenched Letters into the automatic returns, thankfully they had one on each floor, and for the second time that day headed to the library's erotica section. I knew my way now.
I had been briefly tempted to hand the book back to Aristeia but I didn't follow through with that desire. I couldn't hand the book in to her and then immediately borrow the third in the series. That would be too embarrassing, even if a part of me did want to see her reaction. What would that woman look like when someone consciously borrowed an erotica from her? What expression would play across her face?
No, I couldn't. I was a little shocked by the boldness of my idea.
As it turned out however, deliberating on whether I should seek her out was irrelevant, for as I turned the corner into that darkened aisle, I found the end darker than usual. Standing at the far end, blocking out the harsh florescent light and standing surrounded by the warm colours of the books, was Ari.
***
Ari
I'd messed up again. Overtly this time. Accidentally recommend an erotica one time, you can recover from that. Purposely recommend an erotica a second time, you start to look like a pervert.
A small voice reminded me that "pervert" would not be an inaccurate description of the older student who was trying to push erotic lesbian fiction into an undergraduate's hands. She was definitely super creeped out. I bet she was now seriously doubting whether the first time had been an accident! That was why Ellie had never borrowed the third book.
I probably seemed like a massive perverted stalker that was embarrassingly exposing her interest. I did the exact thing I would have hated anyone to do to me -- confront me on liking erotica.
See I'd got overconfident. She'd borrowed the second one. It had turned up on the system. Borrowed and returned in the space of hours. How could anyone ignore that? Just enough time to devour a book that length but not enough time to have left the library, read it at home and returned.
That little undergrad had read that first book right after I had given it to her, I was sure of that now. She had read it before handing it back in. I had not been mistaken in seeing her reading a book but I had been mistaken in thinking it was an academic book. Following that she had returned, after a few weeks of hesitation, and read the second book in one sitting, right here in the library!
Naughty little erotica initiate!
I had giggled when I'd thought of her that way. I was starting to consider myself someone who had opened her eyes to my own private passion. Introduced...or corrupted? It had been fun to think of that shy girl that way. So I'd wanted to push it, tease her a little.
I had rushed to the erotica section after the system had shown she'd returned Drenched Letters. I'm not even sure why. It wasn't a guarantee that she would go to get the third one. In fact under normal circumstances it would be unusual. She'd only just read it after all. If I was that desperate to see her it was a safer bet to wait at the front desk for her. But something pulled me up there, up to the romance and erotica section, and that's where I'd found her.
Or I suppose, she had found me, since she got there second.
I was delighted.
Our meeting came at the cost of me having to pretend to put books back on the shelf. I made a mental note to re-shelve those history journals at a later date. Still there she stood. A little stunned, a little, dare I say flushed? Still cute though.
Tiny shorts showed off her thighs and a slightly-too-big hoodie covered the rest of her. Definitely cute. She did look surprisingly warm though, despite having her legs bare. I wondered if she was one of those people who naturally ran warm.
I mean...there was another reason she could be that hot and flushed, a voice whispered.
Shh! That's just my own imagination speaking. I couldn't let wishful thinking sully the name of this girl. Even if my knowledge of her reading history tainted her a little.
She had paused half way down the aisle, her brain realising too slowly that the kind of book she would be retrieving was not the kind she wished to be seen retrieving. I thought I would help her out. Selfishly I wanted to be the one to do it, to push her onwards in her discovery. So I didn't let her do it herself.
"Here's the third one." I tried to keep my voice steady. Teasing, but not mocking. Calm, but not uninterested. "Reading week starts on Monday, right? You'll have plenty of time to read it then."
She looked shocked as I placed 'Molten Pencils' into her hand. Part three of our little secret. I decided not to push my luck, and left quickly. Little did I know that I'd already pushed way too far.
She hadn't borrowed it from the library.
Molten Pencils. It was tragic that the relationship drama featured in that book had come to be in my own life. One of the leads becomes too overconfident and possessive, thinking their relationship is stronger than it truly was. They push too far and too fast and both of them get hurt from it. A moment of realism I suppose. The characters had only know each other for a short time, of course there were still things to work out. Oh it gets resolved by the end sure, but the foundation of their relationship is strong. The characters were friends for months before becoming lovers. Dripping Words tracks that slow growth. With that foundation it is understandable that they recovered from their falling out and grew closer. But us? How could we strangers hope to cross hurdles that they struggled with?
I'd scared her off with only my third interaction. It had only been our third interaction! Why had I thought we were close?
She had been on my mind a lot, I have to admit that. I'd imagined a number of conversations and interactions, that was probably why I had felt we had more of a connection than we did. You mustn't confuse fiction with reality, that was something I had needed to be reminded of.
I had liked thinking that behind that cute and meek exterior was a person who had read the same erotica as I. Someone the same as me. That was all my over-confidence. Thinking we were closer than we were. She likely had had no idea I knew what she'd just read. Dumping that knowledge on her was pretty rude. While trying to bridge the gap between us too quickly, I had exposed her to the open air.
I was sad. Even if she hadn't said anything to me in person, her refusing to borrow a book she had clearly gone looking for felt like a rejection. I had handed it to her, that had been enough for her to change her mind. How frustrating!
Over reading week I struggled with the creative writing project I'd been tasked to do. Without lectures taking up time during reading week I should have been able to do a good amount of research and writing. Still my motivation and outlook had been effected. It was surprising how strongly my emotions effected my work. That was unusual for me. It seemed my personal rulebook needed to be tossed out when it came to her.
Half way through the week my flatmate had attempted to cheer me up. She hadn't inquired as to the problem, knowing I wouldn't have given her a straight answer, but she could pick up that I was acting unusual so we'd gone out for drinks with some mutual friends.
Some of our friends had used the lack of lectures that week to go home to their families but since many of us were third years or postgrads, a week dedicated to our own personal projects was hardly a chance we could miss. It was a good time to get some serious work done. And I'd wasted it.
Like I'd wasted my chance with her.
I begrudgingly trudged along the path towards the library. I held my coat against me tightly, it was quite damp and cold today. Dark too. Hidden behind the clouds, the Sun had set without being seen. It sets early this time of year but that didn't matter much, I was doing a night shift so I wasn't planning on seeing the Sun much. It would probably be quite an uneventful shift too. A slow, boring shift because most people would have done their reading during reading week and since it was still Sunday, people hadn't yet had any lectures that would give them reading to do. There wouldn't be many people there.
That was a problem because that would likely leave me alone with my thoughts.
I watched the street lights light up my path and marched onwards towards the brightly lit monolith that was the library, preparing for my solitary night spent regretting the actions I committed a week ago in the same building. If only I had another chance to do things right, or a sign pointing to what I needed to do.
Entering I dried my feet on the doormats and headed towards the room behind the main desk, saying an obligatory "hello" to Lisa on the front desk. She began packing up immediately, clearly eager to leave.
I headed into the back room and took off my coat. Luckily the heating inside the library was strong enough that my jumper and black jeans were enough to keep me warm. I brushed my hair back and put it up into a pony tail. My earlier assumption of her eagerness was proven correct by Lisa popping in and grabbing her bag.
"You all good?"
"Uh yeah-"
"Okay cool. I'm heading off now. See you! Have a good shift."
I didn't get a chance to respond before she was out the door. I stared after her and sighed.
Ah well, it wasn't a big enough issue for me to complain about at present. Leaving the desk unattended when there was no one around was hardly an issue. I continued putting my things away and tidying myself up, preparing to take over immediately.
It was at that moment that a loud "ding" rung out across the library, originating from the bell on the desk. It would appear I was not alone in the library.
"Just a second." I called in as soft a voice as I could muster. I smoothed out my jumper, put my lanyard and nametag around my neck and headed out the door to the desk.
My jaw nearly hit the floor.
A girl stood in front of the desk looking embarrassed and uncomfortable. There was no one in the library for her to disturb but she buried her head in the folds and ruffles of her fluffy jumper, clearly cringing at the loudness of the bell. Even in this cold weather, she was again clad in cut off shorts. Her gaze flicked to me as I approached and a wonderful smile lit up her face, before being joined by a bright red flush. This girl truly did run warm.
***
"It's you!" Shit. I was making a habit of that. "Ello-ie." I said, catching myself from using her full name. I needed to do things right this time.
Ellie grinned shyly and lifted her shoulders and arms a small amount as if silently exclaiming "tada" in response to my evident excitement. It was unbearably cute. Had she grown a little more confident?
"I- Ah. You said to come back. If I needed...the next in the series." She stammered, tapping the book she held to her chest and letting her eyes wander around the foyer.
Wait...what? Was that the -- A book from the Dripping Words series? She was borrowing it? After not borrowing it? She was asking me? What?
" -- I did." I didn't know what else to say.
She opened her mouth to speak but her blush burned more and she scratched her neck, delaying herself. She took a breath and prepared to continue.
"I ah -- wanted to do it earlier. But...the other librarian was here...not you..." She trailed off, unable to continue. Her gaze flicked upwards and I got the sense that she was silently continuing her sentence. I followed her eyes and saw they were focused on the corner of one of the tables on the first floor. A coat was draped over one of the chairs and a bag sat next to it. A laptop -- no -- her laptop was set up on the table.
I had to stop myself from gasping. She had set herself up on a seat that could watch over the entrance. More than that she had come to the library hoping to see me, hadn't seen me, and had decided to wait where she could see the front desk. Waiting in case I arrived. Or...until I arrived?
This girl. She was making progress, slow progress but she was undoubtably moving forward. I worried, would she catch and surpass me soon? With each move her pace sped up.
A shiver seemed to run up her body and then she shook herself before forcefully slamming the book onto the table, immediately tensing up on contact and moving backwards, surprised at her own movements. I nearly took a step back too. I only stayed because she gently slid back towards me, as if elastic connected us.
"C-could I borrow this!" She asked forcefully. The energy in her words matching her earlier actions.
"Uh -- yeah sure! Of course." I tried to recover but my mind was still trying to sort out what all this meant. On autopilot I started to process her book but I stopped when the name came up.
"Boiling Ink? But-" I looked up to her, aiming to correct her mistake. "This is book five. You're only on book three aren't you?"
Huh, this was a surprisingly normal interaction between the two of us. I was doing my job around her for once. I was doing things properly.
I didn't think her blush could get any deeper but she somehow managed. Her neck, all the way up to her forehead was bright red. Her actions were bolder, but her reactions were just the same as always.
"Y-you were keeping track?"
Busted! I scrambled to think of something to say but she ended up continuing the conversation by herself.
"I've already read... Molten Pencils, and Melted Lead."
She had! Wow! Wait... My eyes flicked back to her profile. Had I made a mistake? Had I been agonizing for no reason? Was there some error on the system?
Clearly sensing my confusion she hurried on before I could voice any of my questions. Her voice stopping and starting and tailing off at regular intervals.
"I -- I went home for reading week. And I was going to be around my family, right? So I thought... You can't see the cover with an ebook. Yeah... Not that I read it around them...much..."
It made sense. The missing pieces slotted in and suddenly I understood it all.
She wanted to read them. She'd wanted to borrow the books, but going home to her family she could hardly bring borrowed erotica back with her. So she'd decided to buy it as an ebook. Not it, them. She'd read both three and four! And then she'd come back to university, found number five, and waited for me to get here before borrowing it and reading it.
This girl...She was intense. Surprisingly so. I felt my pulse start to rise at the numerous implications. What were we doing?
Before long I had processed the book for her and was handing it back to her. She took it blushingly. Her eyes flicked up to mine and I felt some pressure from her.
What could I say? I felt the need to say something. I couldn't just send her on her way without anything.
"Well, let me know if you need anything else and...enjoy it."
No... that's not what I wanted to say. More. Do it properly, but don't doubt yourself. What you've been doing, at each turn it has turned out okay. Don't doubt yourself. Be careful, don't overstep, but push for what you want. Was that not what she was doing? She was struggling but working hard. I owed it to her to meet her half way!
I leant forward conspiratorially bringing a hand up to cup half my mouth, despite there being no one else around. My action brought her closer on reflex and soon we were closer physically than I think we'd ever been. I could feel the heat radiating off of her face, warming me, threatening to set my skin alight.
In the corner of my vision I could see her thighs, having bent at the waist her shorts bit into her flesh at the front, forming a swell I suddenly became weak for. Thoughts rushed through me.
Were they riding up at the back? What did it look like? Her jumper hung away from her chest as she angled her body down and I wondered where I could stand to catch a glimpse down it. Her fire had spread to me.
I whispered gently to her, "You'll have to let me know what you think of the bookshop scene. It is a scene that has always stuck with me. When I first read it... I could not get it out of my head. I'm hoping you'll empathise with me on that one."
I pulled back but she remained in place. Her mouth was hanging open slightly and I saw her eyes boring into me. Her pupils had grown, her eyes loosing almost all of their brown, leaving her with only a thin ring of sparkling colour. It felt like they were trying to take in all they could of me, like I might get sucked in along with the light.
"Enjoy it." I softly repeated, in a tone I didn't know I had.
She gulped, and blinked, and then straightened so fast her hair flicked around. Her back was terrifically upright and her body suddenly stiff. I wondered, was she desperately holding it all in place?
A moment of doubt crept towards me again, what if I had gone too far again? This time for real? But she dispelled it. Her confidence was spreading to me, and I was rewarded for it.
A giggle swam over to my ears. Her body crumpled up into that giggle as she shrunk her limbs into herself, curling whilst standing. Her face was bright red. I knew nothing was really funny but it seemed her emotions had swollen up inside her to such an extent that laughter was the only way to release it. I was watching a cup overflow in front of me.
"I will." She laughed. "I will!"
She then twisted away and skipped off. Her feet lightly touching the floor, as if skimming across it. Soon, far too soon, she was ascending the stairs and heading back to her seat. Giggles echoed off the walls.
I watched her go. I watched her dance away but even before I attempted to busy myself with work, I soon knew, I would not be able to leave her up there alone. Doing things properly, didn't always mean doing things slowly. What we were heading for, needn't be delayed any longer.

Ellie
I had missed Ari. Oh gosh I had missed her. How could you miss someone you had only seen three times this much? I had been miserable when I realised I wouldn't be able to borrow Molten Pencils from her. I couldn't bring it home. No matter how much I wanted to. But in the same way, at the time, I had felt that I couldn't explain that to her. It was a conversation I had decided would embarrass me too much.
But it was a conversation I wished I had had. Talking to her just now had confirmed it. Ari had been wary of me. Knowing I hadn't borrowed Molten Pencils she must have thought I had rejected her. I had been afraid of that.
I was afraid to tell about how I couldn't borrow that erotic book right then, afraid of how awkward that conversation would be, but avoiding that conversation had only led to upsetting her. Not discussing it had led to her misinterpreting my actions.
It was what I had worried about over reading week, wishing I could contact her and make things clear. Tell her I would borrow it when I came back, right away! But I had no way to tell her, no way to connect to her. Aside from erotica.
I bought Molten Pencils online to connect to her. It was my only method. When I had read it all, and played with myself too, but found myself still alone in my old room, I had to buy Melted Lead. This ritual too, did not summon her. I missed her dearly, but I also realised that reading more of the series, had robbed me of two opportunities to talk to her. I couldn't afford losses like that.
So I held back on the reading, and followed her into erotica with a different method. I still had a romance scene to write after all.
It was a poor first attempt, too focused on the sex and "being" erotica, and it was something I could never submit to my course, and yet I loved it. It was a thrill to write, to create, to flood the page with the passion that was overflowing from me. Uninhibited now, no censoring, no concealing. The words on the pages I wrote that week were what I had wanted all along. I was embarrassed, but I was still writing. That was when I realised how to talk to her when I returned.
If being afraid of awkwardness was the reason I hadn't been able to talk to her, then that wasn't an issue with my awkwardness, I just needed to not let it stop me. In fact, I decided, turn up the awkwardness. Who cares? I was naturally awkward. If the action leads me closer to her then I just don't care what it looks like.
Like the perfect words on a page after a final edit, I had to believe she would be waiting for me, while I took my time stumbling towards her.
And look how I had been rewarded!
I giggled all the way to my seat. Even though I was leaving her, I was carrying Boiling Ink in my hands so, in some way, she was still in my arms.
I did decide to change seats after talking to her. That was the sensible thing to do. Sitting where I had been, I could have looked over the edge and watched her in the foyer but I would have been very visible from below. Given how I was prone to losing myself in these books, I thought I ought not to be seen so easily. I had Boiling Ink with me, and her waiting for me later on. That was enough for now. I think.
I made a big show of packing up and walking up to the fourth floor. I wanted her to know, just in case she wanted to check up on me. Guilty thoughts rushed through my mind but I was already on such a high from talking to Ari that my mental state didn't change much.
I took a bit of a gamble this time. No enclosed booth, just a normal desk. A normal plastic seat and a normal wooden and metal frame desk. There was no one on this floor, I checked. It was safe to get a bit more daring, well sort of safe. Danger aside, or possibly because of it, my time reading was so incredible.
Boiling Ink started with a sex scene. I suppose the author knew what their readers were there for at that point. The main couple were touching, kissing and...licking everywhere they could right from the get go and it was a joy to read. So hot!
I slipped my hand down my shorts quickly but soon I just pulled them down my thighs and allowed my fingers direct access. Oh yeah, did I mention I hadn't worn underwear? Why waste a pair? I knew they wouldn't be covering anything for long.
Smooth skin greeted my fingers and I gently scooped my wetness up and draped it over my clit, allowing my fingers to glide over it with ease. I rapidly started humming to myself, moans being only barely blocked by my lips.
My reading was slower than usual because my eyes kept getting distracted. They flicked around the library at the hint of sound, in case anyone were to see me. No one did, it was false alarms all around, but that didn't stop my heart from beating faster each time. I was loving it.
The erotic scenes were hot and heavy and came frequently. They were only briefly separated by romantic scenes. It seemed there was less drama in this book than the others. That suited me just fine. The mood I was in tonight was definitely agreeing with the book. Drama could wait for another day.
My fingers curled inside myself deeper and I used my hand holding the book and my legs to lift myself off the chair and began riding. My breaths were coming out heavy and in pulses now as I bounced on my fingers, my hair began shielding me from the rest of the world as my head angled further and further downwards. My body was leaning desperately over Boiling Ink and the desk as my hips slammed onto my fingers.
Then I stumbled across it. What she'd recommended to me. The scene she'd especially wanted to share with me. A scene that had stuck with her, aroused her, played muse to her fantasies. The bookshop scene was upon us and I was floating.
Heat pulsed through me as one character pressed the other against the shelves. My body tightened as they slipped lower. My eyes clenched shut just as I read how their tongue pushed inside her folds.
I bit my lip but it wasn't enough, I was going to scream. My head swung back and my mouth opened. Here in the library, I was going to scream. Even alone on this floor my pleasure would resound to the few occupants of the library, and all the way to her.
I couldn't stop my lips from parting. The sound rushed up my throat. My core exploded with pleasure and then...soft lips met mine.
***
Ari
Her eyes shot open, and locked with mine. It was panic at first and then they rolled back as pleasure overwhelmed her. It was me, I was with her. I was the one sitting on her desk in front of her. Knowing this she felt she could relax and let go. Knowing I was with her, she allowed herself to orgasm. Astounding trust flowed into me.
Her tongue burst through her open mouth and met mine, hoping to grab hold of me. In turn, grabbed at her shoulders. I wasn't going anywhere.
She arched into me and shook. This cute little girl, was cumming as I embraced her. It was enough to make me lightheaded.
She forced out little murmurs and whimpers as I held her and kissed her. She broke away from me and gasped for air but I followed her head down intending to prevent further sounds. She had to lean her head back as I lay my lips on her from above. Her eyes fluttered before me and a few strong shakes continued below me before she finally settled. It was then that I pulled away from her.
She slumped back into her chair and her shoulders curled in, her body having lost the strength to sit straight. I took this opportunity to drink in her appearance.
I had crept up to the fourth floor, not expecting too much, but honestly, this girl was too careless. Shorts pulled down, whimpers sounding out quietly, riding her fingers without a care in the world. It was a good job I had checked on her and not anyone else. She was completely absorbed in her book.
I guess I should take some responsibility for that.
I heard a light thud behind me and saw her hand fall to her side, Boiling Ink closed and lay flatly on the table, forgotten for a moment. In its place, I sat on the edge of the table looking at her. Her face was flushed and she looked at me through heavily lidded eyes. A wry smile on her embarrassed face. My eyes flicked down to her crotch and I was impressed.
Wetness shone from her lips but that in itself was no surprise. What was, was that her fingers had begun playing again. She had pulled them out of herself only a few moments ago and yet already, coated in her juices, she had resumed lazily playing with herself. It seemed one would not be enough for her. That was just the kind of woman she was.
I considered my next move, it was a risk. It would mean moving too fast like I always seemed to. However, so far, despite my agonising over it, it had all worked out. Time to try again. Have confidence. Do things properly. Take responsibility.
I hopped off the table and leant on her gently. Her eyes looked up at me, unsure of what was happening. I moved my head forward and kissed her gently on the lips. Her arms reached for me but I brushed them off and pushed them down by her sides. I wasn't staying in this position for long. No use her getting a firm grip now.
I slipped down. I kissed her chin. I kissed her neck. I kissed her collarbone, only slightly exposed behind the material of her hoodie. Then my knees folded and I slid down in one movement, under the table, pulling her shorts with me.
My eyes flicked up to her, she was biting her lip.
Her shorts were down at her feet and I kept them there. I pulled her chair towards me. It ground against the floor with a harsh sound but I didn't care. Her waist was mostly underneath the table and closer to me, that was all that mattered. I could still see her face if I moved forward, and moving forward put my own face in her crotch. Talk about two birds one stone.
My hands reached around her waist and grabbed her butt. It was soft, and pliable. It felt good in my hands. I shifted only her waist closer to me and moved my head between her thighs. Soft skin pressed against both of my cheeks and I flicked my eyes to her. Ellie was watching me intently. Best not to disappoint.
I opened my mouth, stuck out my tongue, and licked.
***
Ellie
Do people still think at times like this? I wasn't sure I was able to. She was warm. Her hands on my butt, her breath on my crotch, her tongue was so wet and felt so amazing. I felt her saliva mix with my juices and I embraced the feeling of another woman licking me. This was a first for me and the fact that Ari was doing it made it so indescribably better.
My hands dove into her hair and my fingers gripped tightly. I occasionally took a look around the library but my infrequent glances would not be enough to prevent our discovery. If someone were to climb the stairs and come around the corner, we would be found, no matter if I was looking or not. As such, I considered keeping watch absolutely pointless. That fact acknowledged, I decided to focus on Ari. Investing in watching her would be much more worthwhile.
Oh goodness she knew what she was doing! She sought out my clit and lavished it with licks. She sucked on my lips and pushed her tongue inside me. I had only orgasmed very recently but she had already cleaned me up and was now pushing me towards another rapidly.
She rubbed her face and nose from side to side too and brushed me with them, unwilling to let any movement go to waste. Her tongue curled up and pressed against the top of my pussy. I pulsed and writhed and I had to force one hand away from her head and up to my mouth. My knuckles bore the brunt of my teeth sinking into them as I tried to stifle my moans.
I missed her tongue and her lips upon mine. They did a better job silencing me than my own hand. However, I would never complain with how she was using them currently. I was in heaven
I was working my way up rapidly. I was heading over the cliff for this woman. She was simultaneously pushing and pulling me there, dragging me onwards. Like she had the entire time I'd known her. But maybe, just maybe, with one of my hands guiding her head, I was starting to pull her along too.
I arched my back, and juices flooded out of me.

Ari
Juices flooded over my lips, and she arched her back. It was intense.
Her thighs slammed together and I couldn't have escaped if I had wanted to. I didn't, but still. Her pussy clenched around my tongue as I licked inside her and soon her juices poured into my mouth and then overflowed. My mouth had not made a perfect seal over her pussy and so I felt splashes against my cheeks and a warm flow over my chin.
If it was not obvious, I was making Ellie cum and loving it.
I carried on licking and grabbing hold of her ass while she came, extending her experience for as long as I could. She shook in my grasp. This girl was expressive when she came.
A high pitched whistle escaped from above me and my eyes caught sight of her fist being bitten harshly, red marks spreading across her smooth skin. The image of those fangs sunk into my naked shoulder appeared in my mind. I could really see myself enjoying this girl. She was special. I was already aware of that.
Her thighs relaxed their grip on me so I moved back a bit. I continued to lick her but it seemed she was still concerned by my movement. Her feet wrapped around my back, holding me from going further. Her breathing was laboured as she came down. Looking at her with her wide smile and bright eyes, I couldn't help but feeling satisfied. I could stay here forever.
Ding!

Ellie
It rang out across the library. Ari hit her head on the table in surprise causing a loud bang and I nearly burst out of my chair. I drew my legs in quickly, away from her -- as if that would disguise what we had done, my thighs were soaked -- and I looked around. Ari too, peered out from under the table, rubbing her now sore head, but she like me could not see anyone.
I stuck my hand underneath the table and beckoned her out. Taking it, she pulled herself up. She drank in the messy state I was in, then reached out and brushed my hair behind my ear, as though she thought fixing my hair could fix the practical problem of my soaked and bare legs and visibly dripping pussy.
I blushed and knocked her hand away before performing the same action myself. Maybe it would help. Just a little.
"That was the bell for the front desk!" I whispered. "That's you!"
She nodded understandingly, before kissing me and starting to move off. The taste on my lips made me blush, but also made me call out to her.
"What?" She hissed back. "You told me to head off."
I stood up, and staggered towards her, my legs still shaky. Pulling my shorts up against my damp crotch I reached into my pocket.
I pulled out a tissue and dabbed at her face.
"You've still -- You've still got my juices on your face." I could barely look at her. I patted at her chin and her cheeks, doing my best to clean myself off her. There was a lot so it was difficult. Ari for her part, just grinned, self-satisfied. I blushed harder at her gleeful expression.
"I've got a washroom in the back. I'll be fine. Besides, who cares if some student sees me with your sweet juices all over me?" She practically gloated.
"Shh. Fine just go. You look fine." I expected that above my head, a heat mirage was forming. The temperature of my cheeks seems to suggest that. For someone who'd just let herself get eaten out in the library, I was acting very shy from just her teasing. I guess she just had that effect on me.
She turned to leave before doubling back. Her lips quickly pressed against mine and I could still taste myself on them.
"I know I look fine. You're the one who needs to tidy up. Your legs need drying." She was right. Even though my shorts covered my crotch, my thighs still showed my fluids. I wondered, was it on my shoes? Just how hard had she made me cum?
She peeked over my shoulder. "As could that chair... University property that! Make sure it's fit for the actual hard working students to use after you!" She scolded, grinning all the while.
With that she dashed off, leaving me with a heaving chest, wet legs, a damp tissue, and one final idea. I needed a book to borrow.

Ari
She didn't come down for about an hour and a half. Between recovering and cleaning up, I didn't blame her for taking her time. I did wonder however, did she expect me to go back up to her?
I wished that I could. Unfortunately I was hit by a small wave of visitors. Students coming to take out books, or return books, one boy just making it before risking a fine, and one girl with an issue with her library card. Between that and other jobs I did actually need to do before midnight, I was kept busy.
I was unable to go to her, but I suppose that was for the best. I doubt I could have kept my hands off her a second time and with the influx of visitors, the risk of being discovered had soared. Not that I think risk mattered much to either of us anymore. The perverted postgrad librarian and the naughty undergrad erotica initiate. I had just eaten out a student in the library, whilst on the clock. Not only that, I had done my job whilst still having her juices drying on my face and tongue. My concept of "risks I can get away with" was probably going to shift.
I licked my lips a few times during conversations and could still clearly taste Ellie's pussy. Oh it was blissful. So blissful that I was reluctant to follow through with my promise, and wash my face off. Begrudgingly however, reason won out. I touched up my makeup and cleaned myself up. It was after this, that she came to visit me, looking far less bedraggled than she had when I had left her, but no less attractive. This woman seriously was a stunner.
We grinned at each other stupidly. It was quite a secret we now shared. We were both still riding high from it. In her hands I saw a book. Its cover did not match Boiling Ink however, the book I had left her with. No, while that book was primarily black, this was startlingly red.
Although still a duller red than Ellie's cheeks.
"What have you got there huh? Can't get enough?"
She grinned, in the most confident way I had seen yet, and placed the book down on the counter proudly. She wasn't hiding it from anyone, not that there was anyone taking any notice. Regardless, I couldn't help but feel a bit smug.
In front of me, once again, sat an erotica. A romantic tale of two lesbians finding love through their shared passion, literature. Tales of drama, sex, and fun were all bundled up in this book. The end of the series, but certainly holding the promise of more.
"Burning Words hmm? The finale is a good one." I smiled. I had enjoyed reading it, but something told me Ellie was enjoying them far more than I ever had. You never forget your first I suppose.
"I expect so! However I do have a bit of an issue..." She replied, leaving the end hanging teasingly.
"Oh yeah?" I asked, opening the first page of the book. I held the scanner over where the barcode would usually be but shortly realised something was covering it. A small slip of paper, like a ruler, or a bookmark. A heart adorned one end, a rose the other, black ink scrawled in between them. I twisted my head to read it. Not words, numbers.
"See when I finish this book. I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I'll have finished the series. I need something to fill my time. To scratch that itch."
I held up the bookmark, staring at the numbers. Staring at Ellie's phone number. Next to the number, were three drips. Clear drips, not ink, another liquid. A liquid with a familiar smell. My face felt hot now.
"I think I'll need some recommendations. Want to get dinner with me some time and... give me some?"
She was grinning, and blushing. She was reaching out to me with all her might, with a bright red face.
I smiled.
"Recommendations over the table this time, or under them?"

Ellie
I toyed with the edges of my jean shorts, and smiled. A small trail of liquid rolled down my legs. My breathing tightened, my face burned and when I looked at her, I could feel myself melt. My eyes locked onto hers and the building faded from around us. It wasn't important right now. I felt like I had started to find were I needed to be. As long as she and I were this close, sharing the same space, that's all that really mattered.
I don't think I will ever get much work done around this woman. How could it be work if it is this much fun?

Epilogue
One Year Later

Ellie
We stopped outside the door. She kissed me on the cheek but I should have known she couldn't be that innocent and cute. With her body shielding me from the rest of the corridor a single finger ran along the front of my leggings, tracing my lips. Don't worry, I smacked her hand quite hard.
"Ari. Later! Okay?" She was grinning initially but then quickly looked away, acted annoyed, and puffed out a sigh.
"Fine! Spoilsport." She grumbled.
Her eyes turned back to mine and from there she continued earnestly, "Good luck babe. You've got this. It's a real great read. I should know. I'm a connoisseur."
I giggled at her looking at me with her arms crossed, looking all important. Sometimes I wondered if she was a bigger dork than me. A dork I loved.
"Thank you. Couldn't have done this without you. Any of it. See you later on?"
"Yeah sure. Come by whenever. But ah -- if you could, come before five, the cleaners are coming then so they can take care of any mess you m-"
"Okay! Get lost! Out you go!" I said pushing her on her way. How had she known what was on my mind?
She laughed and took her leave, knowing I would need to ready myself. She gave me a wave as she headed off towards the linguistics department's office. I turned to the door.
Deep breaths. You've got this. You've worked hard on this. It's kind of crap at the moment but that is why you're talking to him about it. Let's go Ellie!
I knocked on Professor Karl Blythe's door.
"Enter!" Came the booming reply. And so I did.
Inside the large man behind the desk looked up and his face brightened.
"Ah Eloquence. Come in, come in. Sit down!" He beckoned warmly.
"Thank you." I responded. I sat and reached into my bag for the large stack of paper. "I've come with the first five chapters. Like you asked."
"Brilliant! Finally, my star student's long awaited debut!" He was melodramatic as always. Maybe that was why we got on so well. That or our shared literary passion.
"Come now. Let's see it! Let's see it! I'm excited to see the fruits of your labour. Your writing style has gone from strength to strength since you started the module. Time to see the culmination of that, or at least the beginning!"
He wheeled his chair back and looked off into the middle distance, preparing his next dramatic line. I nearly rolled my eyes but it was an entertaining display, even if it was a little embarrassing at times.
"I simply cannot wait to see the first erotic work of the great writer, Ellie Haida!"
I blushed. It was an odd sentence to hear at the best of times. Still, it filled me with a little bit of pride.
Gently, so as not to harm them, I placed the pages upon his desk. A stack of pages, words upon words, flowing from one scene to another. My mind, on paper.
It had taken a while to choose them, but the words fit like nothing else. Who cares for clich√©, or predictability? No other title could work the same. I smoothed out the surface of the first page, so that I, if no one else, could see the bold letters printed across its white face.
"Melting in Your Words." The words greeted me kindly.
