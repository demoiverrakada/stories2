Chapter 2: Daring to Win
We all arrived at 7:30 am sharp as agreed at Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal. When I arrived, I saw Frederick already there, fiddling with his mobile phone in an engrossed manner. He was wearing khaki Bermudas with a white singlet that has an enlarged arm hole. I was wearing jeans with an ordinary sleeveless striped top and a pair of track shoes.
As if on purpose to make a grand entrance, Cassandra was the last to arrive. But both of us couldn't believe our eyes when she came sashaying in. Her top was a long sleeved shirt that we both "telepathically" felt was too grand for the occasion. The top was relatively tight but the front has a very sharp v-shape plunge from her neck to her tummy. Inside, she must be wearing a super-hyper-extra-out-of-this-world push up bra for she looked as if that "thing" was threatening to burst out of her long-sleeved top any moment. Her bottom was a huge contrast. She was wearing a denim shorts that tapered into a v-shape towards her feet. Her ass-cheek was threatening to break out from that little shorts she was wearing. One can only guess how small her panties would be or worse, she went commando. She wore a nice high-heel that seemed out of place to engage in outdoor activities and with a nice pair of sun glasses perched on top of her head.
I saw Frederick swallowed trying to fight the rush of testosterone that must have suddenly surged in his body.
"Hi!" Cassandra greeted us in a warm loud tone.
"Hi. We going beach right?" Frederick remarked sarcastically.
"Yah lah. Dun worry, I have brought bikinis. Hehehe."
I managed a weak, "Hi".
The score flashed in my mind - Cassandra: 1, Ruth: 0. "That girl has beaten me in the morning. I will make a comeback in the night."
=============================================================================
The ferry ride was around an hour. We chit-chatted on various things but I couldn't get my eyes off Cassandra's outfit. How her breasts would bounce when she became too animated whilst she was talking. And that round ass cheek peeking daringly out of her super short shorts that could turn any female into a lesbian.
"How could anyone of that age has such great knockers, unless she has gone for breast implants. But at this age?"
And I could see Frederick like a martial arts master putting every bit of his nei qi into controlling his rising unquenchable urge. It was quite funny to see. I am sure Cassandra must have noticed it and she thoroughly enjoyed exuding such effect over Frederick.
=================================================================================
We arrived on the island and did a quick check-in into our respective resort room. Cassandra and I shared a room whilst Frederick had a room just directly beside us. Thanks to Cassandra's auntie who was able to use her connection as a staff to enable privileges.
We planned to go to the beach but the weather took a turn and it rained. I was secretly happy because my plan would be exposed if we had gone to the beach.
We spent the afternoon playing table soccer and various other activities in the resort.
We surrendered to our Singaporean's gene and treated ourselves to a sumptuous seafood meal. When we made our way back to our resort, it was already night.
Frederick came over to our room to play card game. He was in a black short and grey singlet.
We played several rounds of the card game when Cassandra announced, "Its time for me to take my shower." She grabbed some stuff from her bag and went into the shower whilst Frederick and I continued with our card game.
After half an hour passed, she emerged, wearing a pink panty and when we moved our eyes up to her top, our eyes nearly popped out. She was wearing a DIY cropped top. It was probably an old t-shirt that she has cut away but it was cut so short that we could see part of her exposed bra. She cheekily flashed a smile at us all.
Frederick trying very hard not to look embarrassed, "Er...I have extra singlet or shirt if you need, Cassandra."
"For what har? I am wearing my own already what..."
"Oh...ok. Anytime anyone of you need anything, don't be shy, just ask. We help each other."
"Please lah, this is a resort. Besides, must wear comfortable to have a good nite sleep."
I unconsciously echoed her words as if to strengthen my own courage, "Yup, this is a resort."
I then grabbed my stuff and announced, "My turn next," before proceeding to the shower.
When I next emerged, all eyes were on me. Frederick and Cassandra's jaws were literally open. I was just wearing a white translucent bikini bottom and was stark naked on top. I started to experience cold sweat and hot flushes as their eyes set on me. I was utterly embarrassed, but I consciously thrusted out my chest to counter any unconscious attempt of sloughing and tried to steady my breathing. I knew I must remain like that starting from now if I were to even the score.
Frederick quickly turned away and said, "You go dress up first."
Cassandra also pitched in, "Next time shout for me to pass you your top mah."
I plucked up all my courage and said, "I am already dressed up. This is a resort, remember?"
Frederick turned back to look at me. His eyes were fixed on my breasts. Although they were no way as huge as Cassandra, they were nice round and perky. Due to my vigorous exercise, I was in tip top shape. And to top it all, I have shaved my bottom except for one strip that rose above my bikini line visibly.
"You didn't shave properly..." Cassandra yelled out, trying her best to run me down.
Again, I experienced that huge wave of embarrassment - cold sweat and hot flushes, but in my mind, I reminded myself I needed to proceed with my plan at all cost. I must go through this embarrassment no matter the cost.
I steadied my breathing so my reply will not sound shaky, "Nice? Sexy right?"
And fighting the embarrassment as hard as I could, I managed to muster just enough courage to say, "Frederick, nice?"
"Nice...nice...wow you have a nice body."
I could see Frederick fighting very hard to control his sex drive. He was unconsciously breathing so hard. Cassandra was staring hard at my topless body. I wondered to myself whether she would also strip topless like me just to equalize the game. However, she didn't. I suspected either she felt it would be seen as pointless to copy or she lacked the courage.
I've planned so hard for this. I knew I would chicken out with a top if I didn't utilize a "burn the bridge" strategy. From the start, back at home, I intentionally just packed a bikini bottom. This would ensure that I have no top except the clothes I wore to come here and also forced to sleep fully naked.
I sounded as casual as I could, "Hey let's continue our card game."
Frederick was taken by surprise, "Oh ok."
We played for less than 3 rounds before, Frederick announced sheepishly, "I am tired, I should be going back to rest."
Somehow, after being topless for a while, I no longer found it embarrassing but normal. I shot back, "Go back to rest or do something?" and gave him that dirty look.
He tried to look innocent and said, "No...no. I mean do what?"
I laughed out loud. I noticed I was the one who was now acting normal after having gone past my embarrassment.
"Hey guys, this is the only piece of clothing beside my jeans and top I brought to the resort. I need to go buy a beachwear if we are going to the beach tomorrow."
"Sure. We leave at 9:30 to buy your bikini," Frederick sounded enthusiastically.
"Beachwear lah, who say I am buying a bikini?"
"This is not topless beach."
"I know. You worry I go beach like that ah? You don't like to see maybe got other people like to see."
"No I like to see. I mean, you have a nice body but cannot go outdoor like that."
I just giggled.
Frederick left the room. And I really wondered what he did.
Cassandra seemed unnaturally quiet. She softly said, "I am also tired. Let's sleep."
By now, I was quite used to this state. However, I needed to do one more thing with the lights on to cement my victory for today. I knew I could wait for the light to be off before proceeding and that would be so much easier for me. I nonchalantly slipped off my bikini bottom and put it on top of my suitcase.
I tried to muster as much courage as possible to walk slowly to the light switch to turn off the light. Some how I felt that Cassandra must be staring at my stark-naked body the whole while. She had experienced more daring voyeuristic display from me in the last hour than she would ever experience from anybody in her lifetime. But I am crystal clear this is only the beginning. To win this rivalry battle, I would need to muster all my courage!
As we settled in bed, I smiled in the darkness to myself. Ruth:1 Cassandra: 1.
Thus ended Day 1 of our adventures.
