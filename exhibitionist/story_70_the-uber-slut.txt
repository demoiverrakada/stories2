You're just doing your thing, going through the expected roster of late night customers as you pull yet another grave yard shift on a Saturday. You have seen it all; high powered businessmen taking a bump with far less discretion than they imagine; worried people needing to get somewhere unexpected fast - a hospital, a relative's home. And of course the requisite drunk bimbos out having a "girl's night".
But you don't expect this. She barely says a word to you as she takes a call from the person she had a date with that night ... a date that seemed to have gone well, despite lacking a grand finale. And unexpectedly her date, as she speaks to him with her earbuds in (and thus not completely aware of how loud she is *actually* being), asks her to do a few things to show him how much she enjoyed the date... and you can see it all in the rear view mirror. Then, she remembers that she isn't alone, and her response is more than a little surprising.
