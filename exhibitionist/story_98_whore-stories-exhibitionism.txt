Exhibitionism and Voyeurism make the world go around. Whether dating sex, forbidden sex, cheating sex, incestuous sex, or sexual seduction sex, exhibitionism and voyeurism are a big part of sex. Exhibitionism is what woman naturally have to attract men. Whether it's their pretty face, long, lush hair, or sexy and shapely body, what they look like is what attracts men to them. Then, when women take it a step further by flashing men up-skirts and down-blouses, let the fireworks begin. As long as men are always looking, women are always willing to show.
From up-skirts peeks of panties to down-blouse views of bras and cleavage, from up-nightgowns of naked pussies to down-nightgowns of naked breasts, women enjoy showing men as much as men enjoy seeing of women. From short skirts and low-cut tops, to see-through tops, and to itsy, bitsy, teeny, weenie, yellow, polka dot bikinis, men want to see more of women. Men love seeing bras, panties, naked breasts, naked asses, and naked pussies.
Sex, sex, sex, life is all about sex. Money, money, money, life is all about money. When life isn't about sex, it's about money. Most times interchangeable with one a big part of the other, wherever sex is, money follows, and wherever money is, sex follows.
"Honey. May I have your credit card? I need to go shopping to buy shoes."
Walter reached in his back pocket and pulled out his wallet. He pulled out his credit card and held it up to her as if teasing her with it. He looked up at his trophy wife and gave her a dirty smile.
"I'll give you my credit card if you promise wear nothing but your new shoes when you return home," he said with a dirty laugh.
She grabbed the credit card from his fingers.
"Deal," she said. "How many friends will you invite over this time while I model...my new shoes?"

Exhibitionism and voyeurism are everywhere. We can't go anywhere without seeing something of women that we shouldn't see. Whether in our cars, at the mall, in the cinema, or at home while watching television, there's naked and semi-naked women everywhere.
"Show me your tits," read the signs held by men standing in the stands of race tracks, baseball parks, football stadiums, ice skating rinks, and at soccer games.
Not having to twist their arms, thousands of women willingly and voluntarily lifted their shirts and lifted their bras, if wearing bras, to show men their naked tits. Seemingly, women loved showing their naked breasts as much as men want to see their naked breasts. Their topless, naked images were flashed across the huge Jumbotron screen for everyone to see their naked breasts. Showing the topless images of a multitude of women, the big screen was filled with naked breasts.
"Yeah," cheered the fans! "Yeah," said the Jumbotron in big letters.

"Show me your tits," read the signs held by men standing outside the ladies' shower room at campsites.
Nearly every female camper emerging from her shower wrapped in only her towel lower their towels to show the men holding their signs, their tits. Some women even opened their towels toe show the men their naked pussies too.

"Show me your tits," read the signs held by men standing outside hospital entrances and the entrances to hospital emergency rooms.
As if it was a job requirement to flash men their tits, most female nurses and some female doctors complied.

"Show me your tits," read the signs held by men standing outside of plastic surgeons' offices.
A good place to see naked tits, albeit surgically enhance naked breasts, yet, proud and sexually satisfied with their new tits, breast implanted women couldn't wait to show off their new breasts.
# # #
"Show me your tits," read the signs held by men standing across the street from their neighbors' houses.
While the women changed their clothes with their light on and their shade not drawn, most female neighbors accommodated the men by showing them their naked tits.
# # #
"Show me your tits," read the signs held by men standing outside the Catholic Sisters' Convent of the Most Holy Virgins.
Not shy about showing men what God gave them, the nuns pulled their long, black habits over their heads to flash their naked breasts to men. Something that most men never expected, many of the nuns were tattooed. Some had tattoos of crucifixes while others had tattoos of religious slogans, "God is Great. I Love Jesus. My Body and Soul Belong to God. Some of the other tattoos that nuns had weren't as religious. "I Love Showing My Tits. I Love Having Sex with Priests. The Devil Made Me Do It. As much as I love Deadwood, I Love Hardwood."
Returning the sexual favor, before flashing the men standing outside the convent their naked breasts, some nuns held up signs too.
"Show me your naked prick."
"I'll show you my tits if you show me your naked dick."
"Tits for cock."
"Flash me your prick and I'll flash you my tits."
"God bless you sisters for showing me your tits," said the men holding the signs.
"Peace be with you," said the nuns when blessing the men for asking to see their naked breasts after showing them their naked breasts and after the men showed them their naked pricks.

"Show me your tits," read the signs held by men standing outside of the Capital Building in Washington...and many of the female representatives and senators did with one stipulation.
The female politicians smiled while all saying the same thing.
"We'll gladly show you our tits as long as we can continue to count on your voting support," said the legislators before flashing their naked tits.
# # #
"Show me your tits," read the signs held by men standing on the red carpet outside of Oscar Awards, the Emmy Awards, the Grammy Awards, and the Tony Awards.
Most women attending in the galas in their sexy, designer, low-cut gowns lower the tops of their gowns to flash the men their naked breasts.

"Instead of giving me a tip, show me your tits," read the button on the hat of the pizza delivery man.
Women were happy to oblige. They not only showed their tits but also, they still give the pizza delivery man a tip.
# # #
"Show me your tits," read the button on the hotel uniform of the room service man.
While their husbands were in the shower or videotaping his wife showing her tits, the women all showed the room service men their naked breasts and gave them a tip, too.
Seemingly, all that it takes for obliging women to show men their naked breasts are handwritten signs held by perverted men asking to see their naked tits. So simple, too simple, all it takes for men to see naked breasts is to patiently wait for women to oblige their exhibitionistic requests to show them their naked breasts. Seemingly, most women are happy to accommodate men and show them their naked tits. Sometimes, all it takes is to be at the right place and at the right time to see naked tits.

In a perfect world, women, even your mothers, especially your mothers, are exhibitionists and men, especially you, are voyeurs. I'm not telling you anything you don't already know. Exhibitionists and voyeurs are equally important in helping to make the world go around by selling products in stores, on television, and online. Just as without exhibitionists, we wouldn't have voyeurs, without voyeurs we wouldn't have exhibitionists.
Exhibitionism and voyeurism go hand-in-hand much in the same way as sex and money. Codependent and with one enabling the other, just as we can't have sex without money, we can't have money without sex. Think about it. Sex and money, money and sex, no one would want one without the other.
"How much for a blowjob?"
With apologies to no one, no ands, buts, ifs, maybes, and/or pretenses, I'm an exhibitionist. Further, I'm proud to be an exhibitionist. I love showing my sexy and shapely body to men and to some women. I love showing men and some women what they shouldn't see of me. I deliberately flash men and some women my panties, my bra, my naked ass, my naked tits, and/or my naked pussy. Sexually shocking but true, I love showing unsuspecting people, people I don't even know, what they should never see of me.
When men sexily stare at me, a game I love to play, while making my flashing appear accidental, I enjoy returning the favor of their voyeurism with my exhibitionism. Happy to show men what they want to see, it sexually arouses me to show them my bright white, bikini panties, my long line of sexy cleavage, and my low-cut bra. As much as it sexually excites men to see my naked tits, my naked pussy, and/or my naked ass, it sexually arouses me to show men my naked tits, my naked pussy, and/or my naked ass.
"Am I a whore? I may be but I think not. I think I'm normal. I believe there are more women like me who enjoy flashing men than not."
As if waving my arms in the air and jumping up and down while saying, "Look at me. Look at me. I want to show you something," I show people all that they hoped to see and wanted to see of me.
Something I've always done and still continue to enjoy doing, it sexually arouses me to flash and expose myself, especially to men. Yet, more than one would think, not alone in my exhibitionism, as much as most men are voyeurs, many women are exhibitionists. Many women enjoy flashing their sexy underwear and showing their shapely, topless, and/or naked bodies to horny, adoring, and perverted men. Further, horrifically doomed, as if bitten by a vampire, many women who were sexually abused, especially those who never sought psychological help, oddly enough, become exhibitionists.
Sad but true, sexual abuse is the common thread in the link to women becoming attention-seekers by exposing their underwear clad, topless, and/or naked bodies to men. Many women who have been sexually abused, especially those who never sought psychological help become whores, strippers, prostitutes, drunks, and/or druggies. Many women who were sexually abused are doomed to repeat the patent of sexual abuse with their own adult children. Sorry to write but terminally depressed and full of rage, unless they seek help, many women who were sexually abused will never maintain a normal relationship or have a happy marriage.
Sad for me to write, as if I have post-traumatic stress syndrome for all that happened to me in my life, I'm one of those women. Alone with my bad self, when I'm not angry, I'm always sadly depressed. Unless I'm with my friends, my own kind, sluts, whores, prostitutes, and strippers while telling one another dirty stories, I'm never happy. Because we've had similar sexual and violent experiences, we have an unbreakable bond, a kinship, and a friendship that only someone who has survived what we survived can understand.

Even though most women will say that they're not exhibitionists, indeed, they are. Trust me, women don't go through all the trouble of doing their hair, putting on makeup, and wearing sexy clothes to be ignored. Yet, unless they want to be taken and literally forced to have sex, women want to be in sexual control. Women want to be the sexual seductresses and the sensual seducers. They want sex on their own terms. Instead of a quick fuck from behind, they want to savor the sexual time together while facing one another and kissing while making love. Only, men want quickies. Women don't.
Unless the man is good looking and/or rich, women don't want to be leered at and/or stared at by some pervert looking for sex. Unless they want the man to sexually seduce them, unless they want the man to physically take them, they don't want men to be the seducers. Women want to have it all their way albeit without looking like and being perceived as whores. If men can do that, they'd have a much better chance of sexually scoring with women.
"Whore! You dirty whore!"
Women love sexually teasing men by flashing them while making their flashes appear accidental and not intentional when, in most cases, their flashes are, indeed, deliberately done. They want men to see all that they want and hope to see of their bodies. Unfortunately, instead of biding their time and waiting for the right moment, most men misread the cues and come on too strong.
Instead of playing the game of voyeurism and exhibitionism, they play the game of forced sex. Instead of enjoying and savoring the moment, frightening women instead seducing them, men are too quick to grab and grope. Men need to take a breath and take things slower. Instead of leering and scaring women away, they need to slow things down. They need to show more respect and sexual sophistication by playing it cool.
"Hey, baby, wanna fuck?"
The woman looked at him as if he was a rapist.
"Fuck off, asshole! Security!"
Moreover, just because a woman flashes a man, doesn't necessarily mean that she wanted to have sex. She could be just playing while sexually teasing. She could be just practicing being an exhibitionist. She could be enjoying and savoring the moment in the way that she wanted and hoped the man would do the same. She could be instructing him how to play the game of exhibitionism, voyeurism, and sexual teasing.
I can't tell you how many times I've deliberately flashed men up-skirt views of my panties to get their attention. I can't tell you how many down-blouses peeks I gave men to get them interested. Up-skirt views and down-blouse peeks are some of the tools that women use to sexually attract men. Two-for-one, because I'm so tall, 5'10" tall and taller with heels, just by leaning over a counter, I'm able to flash my panties to men standing behind me and flash my bra and cleavage to men standing in front of me.

One of my favorite flashes is when wearing a short, flared, skirt on a warm, windy day. As my excuse not to fix my skirt, I carry my handbag in one hand and a package in my other hand. After walking while exposing the back of my panties to whomever is walking behind me, I'd have a line of men following me. Pretending that I wasn't aware that the back of my skirt was blowing higher than my hips. With my skirt blowing in the wind and all the way up to the small of my back in the wind, I continue walking with my panties totally exposed.
It's so easy for women to flash men any part of their sexy bodies. Another way to flash men is to catch my skirt between my thigh and handbag while it's raised past my hip. Showing anyone walking behind me my panty clad ass, that is when wearing panties, I'd have a line of men following me again, too.
My favorite place to flash men is at the mall. Resting while sitting on a bench to look at my phone, I sit with my skirt raised and my knees parted just enough for anyone sitting across from me or walking by me to see my panties. As if they've never seen a woman's panties before, I'm always surprised by how many men will hang around me while staring at all they can see of me.
Going up the escalator while wearing a short skirt and bending at the waist as if fixing my shoe is another great way to flash my panty clad ass and the back of my panty clad pussy. Finding a dressing room that still has curtains instead of a door is another great way to have some sexy, flashing fun. With them able to see me through the mirror, I leave the curtain open just enough for men to watch me undress and dress. There are always men standing outside waiting for their wives or girlfriends while watching my sexy, flashing show.
Sitting at the food court with my knees parted wide open is another great way to flash men my panties beneath the table. Hiking up my skirt with the aid of a backpack is an innocent way to flash men the back of my panties. Hooking my skirt with the end of my umbrella and quickly lifting the umbrella as if to open it is another great way to expose myself. Getting out of a car with my legs spread and reaching back inside over the front seat as if I forgot something is another great way to flash my panties.
Yet, they all fail in comparison to flashing my panties or naked pussy at the shoe store. Wearing a short skirt whether with or without panties, as soon as the shoe salesman sits on the low stool in front of me, I know he has a bird's eye view up my short skirt and in between my shapely legs. By the continuation of his sexual stare, I know that he can clearly see my panty clad pussy or my naked cunt. It makes me wet watching him staring. It makes me sexually aroused knowing that I'm giving him an erection.
Making the flashing show even more outrageous, I have him help me trying to put on a pair of boots that are a size too small. Parting my legs wider while lifting my leg higher to fit the boot, I enjoy giving him all that he hoped and wanted to see of me. Always, when the poor man finally stands, he covers his erection with a shoe box. Then, when he takes too long to return, I wonder if he's in the storeroom masturbating over all that he saw of my panties or my naked pussy.

Now that they're functioning adults and pilots of their own destinies, alas, sexually abused women continue to remain prisoners to their pasts. As if they can't help themselves, they still get off on exposing themselves to men they never met, especially to men they'll never see again. As the targeted recipient to their show of nudity, a man doesn't have to hold up a sign asking a woman to show him her naked tits because she will. While pretending that she's unaware that men are looking, many women enjoy showing men all they hope and want to see of their underwear clad, topless, and/or naked bodies.
Yet, even though many women are exhibitionists, many women aren't as honest and open about why they deliberately expose themselves to men as well as to some women too. They're not as forthcoming as to why they enjoy showing their underwear clad, topless, and/or naked bodies as I am honest and open about my exhibitionism. Perhaps, having never sought out help, they may not even know why they are the way that they are. Yet, even though I've had years of psychological help, and know better, I still enjoy flashing my panty clad, topless, and/or naked body.
Nonetheless, whether they know why they do what they do, confusing the issue by lying about it, even when women dress like sluts, many women pretend they're not sluts when, indeed, they are sluts. Further, even when they're sexily dressed and willingly and voluntarily showing men all that they hope and want to see of their bodies, they pretend they're not exhibitionists when, indeed, they are exhibitionists. Even when they have promiscuous sex and are stroking cocks, sucking cocks, and fucking cocks while stripping themselves naked, they pretend they're not whores when, indeed, they are whores.
"How dare they? Exhibitionists! Whores!"
Even when women deliberately show their bikini panties, their long line of sexy cleavage, and their low-cut bras, they're quick to make men feel like perverts for looking when they're ones who are showing. At the very least, they're not only complicit in their exhibitionism but also responsible for men's voyeurism. It takes two, a woman who wants to show and a man who needs to look.
"Show me your tits," read the sign at NASCAR and INDY car races around the country.
Instead of being offended that men wanted to see their naked breasts, taking up the challenge, women obediently obeyed and showed men they don't know and have never met, their naked breasts.
"What's wrong with women to do that? Why would they expose their naked tits to men because of a sign? Sluts! Whores! You deserve what you get."
# # #
Easily offended by vulgarity, by dispersions of gossip, by unfounded, sexual rumors, and/or by the lustful, sexual stares cast their way, some women even go as far as pretending they're ladies. Absurdly laughable at best, yet, most men don't know any better. The men who do know who they're dealing with know that they're not ladies, they're sluts. They're not ladies, they're whores. Putting lipstick on a pig doesn't make them any less of a pig.
"Pig! You're a filthy pig! Get on your knees and suck my cock. I need to cum in your mouth."
For them to daringly and deliberately show as much as they do to unsuspecting men, trust me, even though they go out of their way make their flashes appear accidental, they're no lady. Instead of accepting that they're sluts and whores, they act as if they've virgins. They act as if their flashes were unintentional when their flashes were deliberately planned.
"Oh, my God, Sister Mary Elizabeth, I'm so sorry to have come upon you by surprise. I'm so sorry to have frightened you while you were sitting on the floor with your habit over your knees and your legs spread wide open. I didn't see anything. I immediately turned head away and averted my stare when I saw that your pubic hair was shaved in the shape of a crucifix," said the priest.
# # #
Taking umbridge at being called a slut or a whore for flashing, they act as if they've never had a hard cock in their hands, in their mouths, in their pussies, and/or in their asses. A game that women have successfully played for thousands of years, men never tire of seeing what they shouldn't see of women, and women never tire of showing men all that they know that men want to see of them. Unfortunately, with flashing not stopping there, one sexy thing usually leads to another sexy thing.
Yet, hoping to limit their exposure to just flashing, women go out of their way to make their flashes appear accidental and/or unintentional. By making their flashes appear accidental, they act as if it's not their fault that they flashed men up-skirt views of their panties or down-blouse views of the cleavage and bra. It's the men who take things a step too far when wanting to do more than just looking.
With no one else to blame but themselves, women act as if they're innocent virgins and men are dirty dogs. They act as if they're unaware that their sons and/or their sons' friends saw their naked pussies when they seductively crossed their legs when wearing a nightgown without panties and without having the modesty to wear a robe over it. When leaning over their sons and/or their sons' friends, they act surprised and/or violated when horny, young men stare down their open nightgown top at their naked breasts.
"Show me your tits...Mom," in the way he stared down her nightgown top at her naked breasts long and hard, her son may as well held up a sign that read, show me your tits.
They act as if they weren't aware that their sheer nightgowns become totally transparent in a darkened living room when walking in front of the TV. They act as if they weren't aware that the bright illumination of an opened refrigerator door in a dark kitchen is like walking through a TSA screening site. They pretend they didn't know that when pushing open the drapes on a bright, sunny day, the sun will make them look as if they're naked. By putting the onus of blame on men's voyeurism, women go out of their way to not make men think of them as whores.
"Oh, my God. My towel came undone. I'm naked. I'm so embarrassed, so very embarrassed. Please don't look at my naked tits, my naked ass, and my naked pussy."
How dare women sexually tease men by deliberately exposing themselves to them and then to deny that they're deliberately flashing them while blaming men for looking? Why would they go as far as to pretend that they don't want men to see all that they're showing and all that men are seeing? Are they trying to save their reputations by blaming their exhibitionism on men's voyeurism? Is that it? Are they trying not to have men perceive them as the whores that they truly are? Is it as simple as that? A sexy game that women enjoy playing, in truth, if women don't know who they are, then men surely do.
"Whore! You're such a whore! How dare you? How could you expose your naked body to him? How could you allow him to touch you and feel you everywhere that he should never touch and feel you? How could you have sex with him? How could you stroke his prick, suck his prick, and fuck his prick? What's wrong with you? How could you have sex with your own son?"

Baffling and sexually frustrating men for thousands of years, plain and simple, besides being whores, sluts, and exhibitionists, women are con artists, liars, and frauds. They are not who they say and/or pretend who they are. Whether jobs, money, marriage, or babies, they use their sexuality to get what they want from men. While deliberately sexually teasing naïve men, good men, and innocent men, entrapping them, how dare women inaccurately comport themselves in that sexually stimulating way while claiming otherwise?
Deceivingly conniving women are quick to save their reputations by denying men's and other women's sexual allegations when anyone calls them a whore. When anyone verbally offends them by calling them a slut, or physically attacks them with a touch, a grope, or a feel, they're quick to react with their ladylike trump card. They're quick to take umbridge by someone's rude accusations. As if offended when men merely stare and/or complimentarily comment at all that women are showing, those women act as if they're virgins by acting abruptly offended.
They pretend that they're unaware that they're showing all that they're showing. They pretend that they don't like it when guys look at them in a sexual way when, of course, they do. They pretend that they're not acting sexual and/or dressing in a sexy way when, of course, they are. Trust me, ready to give men a sexy, sexual show, women want men to look. They want men to comment on their clothes, their looks, and on their sexy and shapely bodies. Then, as their way to defend their reputations, they're free to give them a sexual retort.
"Oh, my God. I caught you looking up my skirt. You were staring at my panties. I saw you looking down my blouse. You were staring at my cleavage and bra. You pig! How dare you stare at me in such a sexual way? I feel so violated. I feel so used and abused."
Women, all women, love the sexual attention that leering and staring men give them. Even when they say otherwise, they love sexually exciting men by erotically and sensuously teasing them. It's their ultimate compliment when they give men they don't even know, have never met, and haven't been formally introduced, an erection.
The biggest silent compliment that men can give them and that women truly enjoy is when they make men hard by deliberately flashing them something they shouldn't see. Successful in their exhibitionism and sexual teasing, their sexual satisfaction is to leave men horny, sexually frustrated, and wanting to see more of them. Just as all men, especially you, are voyeurs, all women, especially your mothers, are exhibitionists.
"Is that a kielbasa in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?"
THE END
