--
It was a fantasy she harboured for quite some time. However, last night, Jack managed to get his wife Lena to confess her most secret fantasy. Normally shy in bed, so shy she wasn't even comfortable using the word "cock", she finally confessed to having had fantasies about fucking faceless strangers with big cocks - cocks that were bigger than his.
As compensation, over the years of his marriage, he had made extra effort in bed with the hopes that everything else he did would satisfy his wife. He would use foreplay extensively - gentle kisses, sucking on nipples, finger fucking and licking her pussy, before finally fucking her with his modest tool. Last night, when she finally confessed her fantasy to him after much egging, Jack knew in that moment, no matter what else he did, he could never compete with a man who possessed a bigger better cock.
In the middle of their lovemaking, at the height of arousal, Jack had asked if she have had any fantasises. Reluctant to answer at first, in fear of making him jealous or hurting his feelings, Lena finally relented. "Yes, I do. I have fantasies that involve other men.
"Do you really want to know? Ok, Jack. I admit. Their cocks are usually significantly longer than yours, dear." With her free hand, she had traced above Jack's cock just how long. With a teasing smile, "Not necessarily that much thicker, but definitely longer. Like, several inches longer."
Lena had said what she said without malice, but the words brought forth a mix of emotions within Jack. He was initially overwhelmed, even stunned, but then his curiously gave him courage to find out more.
"Lena, would you like to fuck someone other than me? Perhaps someone with a bigger cock, who can satisfy you in ways I cannot?"
It was a confronting question! Now well into the night, Lena recalled, after he had cum on her face and she had cleaned up, they snuggled in bed like newlyweds. Both still naked, he had hugged her tightly and she felt his warmth. He was perfect in every way. Yes, he didn't have a big cock, but a big cock wasn't everything. The sex with her husband was adequate, good sometimes, but never bad.
After sex, Jack had fallen asleep quickly from exhaustion. He was drained mentally and physically. A lot had happened during their short session. As Lena laid awake, she wonder if their sex talk was simply talk. Was is simply fantasies brought into the bedroom between husband and wife to increase stimulation?
She was left alone with her forbidden thoughts, painfully aware that despite the mental and physical stimulation, she had yet to orgasm. Every bit of her still felt incredibly horny and alive.
Soon, Lena found her mind wandering and began fantasising. It didn't take long at all for her body to quickly respond. She felt the familiar tingling between her legs and her breath quickening, as her excitement grew. However, as the shape of her imaginary man started to form, she also wondered if it was wrong to compare her husband to her fantasies.
The fantasy itself as vivid. Her hands involuntarily moved downwards and she could feel the warmth spreading between her legs. She moaned softly as she touched herself. The image of her big cock lover appeared. He had a big muscular frame. He was someone stronger and bigger than her husband. She could almost imagine the feeling of fullness as his cock entered inside her.
Lena couldn't stop herself. She let out a soft whimper. She bit her lip and tried to stay quiet desperately, but the moan came out nonetheless. It felt wrong, she knew that, but the thought of this stranger was so tempting it was difficult to stop.
She wondered whether she was being disloyal to Jack. Was thinking considered cheating? Would he ever feel threatened by her desires? How could a man face knowing his wife fantasised about other men?
Yet, Jack didn't seemed angry earlier when she revealed her fantasy. In fact, he had never looked hornier. So much so, Lena recalled how he had asked her the most taboo of all questions. How could a man ask his wife to fuck another man, even if it was just fantasy talk?
The lover in her head was tall and masculine. He had broad shoulders with well defined abs. Confidently, her lover had approached her as she laid on the bed she shared with her husband. He was so confident, that she found him irresistible. He stood at the foot of the bed completely naked. His cock was long, thick and hard. It was pointing like a pole straight at her pussy.
Lena heard herself moan softly at the sight, her eyes scanning her lover's torso down to his manhood. Involuntarily, an image of Jack had flashed in her mind and she couldn't help but notice how much bigger her fantasy lover's cock appeared compared to her husband's.
A fleeting thought passed by - she had reminded herself reality often failed to live up to expectations. Perhaps this obsession with size wouldn't last forever. Maybe it was just a phase, driven by her biology. After all, it's natural for a beautiful young woman to be turned on by a man with all the important characteristics that defined a man. Jack was everything else she desired in a partner. Intelligent, kind, considerate... she loved him wholly, completely. He was her husband.
"Oh fuck me hard," she whispered to herself, "Fuck me deep and hard."
She spent some time in her bed as her husband slept, imagining her lover's cock fucking her in vivid detail. Every so often the image of her husband's smaller cock would flicker in her mind. The thick member would stretch her pussy tightly, reaching deeper than her husband ever could. In her fantasy, she had rode her lover's cock long and hard, all the while in the real world, finger fucking herself feverishly in rhythm.
"Your cock is so big. It feels amazing," she whimpered.
Her fantasy became more intense. Her fingers moved faster. Her breathing quickened. Her hips started buckling. Her body begged for release. Closing her eyes, she willed herself to stay in control, to prolong the sensations. However, the pleasure was too much and she cried out as her orgasm erupted within her body. Through it all, her fingers worked furiously as she rubbed herself to intensify her release. Unable to stay quiet, her moans echoed through the room.
It was a powerful orgasm, probably a sum of the arousal from her earlier session with Jack and also her big cock fantasy. She gasped loudly, biting her lower lip to stifle her scream so as not to wake her sleeping husband.
She couldn't deny the thrill she got from the thought of being taken by a stranger. The power exchange, the taboo nature of such an encounter, it all seemed irresistible. But most importantly, the ideal of a bigger cock promising greater satisfaction was intoxicating. What would it be like to actually give in to her desires? To allow herself to be taken by a man whose sole purpose was to please her? Wouldn't Jack be incredibly jealous? Could this actually happen?
Jack laid next to his wife. He did not say anything. He did not move. He did not react. He merely observed silently as his wife brought herself to satisfaction. He was sure she did not know he was awake, that he witnessed her actions.
--
Dusk cast its warm embrace upon the couple, the sun setting behind the city skyline visible through the expansive windows of their luxurious hotel suite.  Now, a week later, Lena was in the hotel with Jack on a weekend getaway. Jack suggested they spend some quality time together after a hard week at work to reconnect. In many ways, she was relieved to spend some time with Jack. During the week, neither made any mention of the last weekend's revelations. Lena wondered if it was simply pillow-talk between husband and wife during an intense lovemaking session.
Did they really mean it or was it pure fantasy? It many ways it was awkward. She decided not to delve too deeply into her own thoughts regarding the matter, instead focusing on the daily routine.
For Jack though, things could not have had been more different. Throughout the week, Jack could not keep his mind away from the idea of his wife, firstly admitting to fantasising about fucking bigger cocks, and secondly the possibility of her actually doing so in real life. He barely got any work done as he couldn't concentrate.
To make matters worst, his colleague at work, Brian, was announced as the company's best sales assistant last month. He had burst into Jack's office happy as happy can be and had wrapped his strong arms around Jack hoisting him in the air.
"Jack, we have to celebrate. You and your lovely wife are both invited over my place next weekend. Some of the other folks from sales will be coming." Brian asked, "Bring your lovely wife, we'll party my bonus away. What do you think buddy?"
Truthfully, Jack wanted some alone time with Lena. He wanted to find the right moment to talk to Lena again about her fantasies. He found it had deeply consumed him all week, wondering how she really felt about sex with him, why she fantasises and whether she really wanted to fuck someone for real.
The uncertainty drove him wild with passion. The more he thought about it, the crazier it felt. Often he was agitated at work and his sleep was restless. He knew he needed to confront her directly and express what he really thought at some point.
"Ok, Brian. Sure, we'll come to your place," Jack had heard himself respond. It was this exact moment when Jack decided a weekend getaway would be perfect for continuing exploring the boundaries of their newfound revelation. They didn't live far from Brian at all, but Jack thought a hotel overnight stay would take them away from their routine.
"What should I wear, darling?" Lena had asked innocently without noticing anything off about Jack as she was getting ready for the evening. She pulled out a red dress from her luggage, slipped it on and had modelled it for him. It was a short red dress he had seen her wear before. The hem of the dress barely covered her petite ass. It was that short.
"Anything comfortable," Jack said absentmindedly, not paying attention to the clothes discussion.
Instead, his mind drifted back to their conversation a week ago where he confessed how he was willing to let his wife fuck another man, if it meant satisfying her needs. Even though he tried to repress the feelings of envy and jealousy, there remained a lingering excitement about the prospect of seeing her with another man and watching her beautiful body succumb to some other cock. He was torn between possessiveness that comes from being a husband, yet also yearning to witness her pleasure under another man's touch.
Now at the luxurious hotel suite, standing in front of the mirror, Lena gazed at her reflection. She accepted how she looked tonight. The deep red hue of her short dress accentuated her milky complexion and brought out the luminosity of her light brown hair. Admiring her appearance, she couldn't resist running her hands along her curves, enjoying the way the silky fabric caressed her skin. With each movement, her anticipation increased, turning her thoughts towards the evening ahead. To complete the look, she laced up her high heels.
Jack had emerged from the bathroom with a towel, still dripping wet from his shower. He watched his wife open the curtains after getting dressed. As she reached up, her short red dress rode up her tiny back, exposing the lacy black underwear barely covering her ass. He hoped that the setting tonight at this hotel and at Brian's might inspire further conversations about their fantasies and desires. Seeing his wife standing in front of the window, appreciating the view, he walked over and placed his hand on her shoulder.
"Brian texted me his address. We should get going," he informed her casually.
Lena smiled at Jack warmly, letting her arm slide across his chest briefly before moving to dry her wet palm against his towel. He stepped closer to her and placed his arms around her waist. Glancing downwards, he noticed the outline of her nipples through the thin material of her dress. His heart began racing and immediately his blood rushing southward.
The mere sight of her, dressed provocatively in that sexy red number, sent waves of lust coursing through his veins. Unable to control his impulses, he kissed her neck, whispering words of affection, wanting nothing more than to consume her whole.
"You look stunning tonight. That red dress is so sexy."
Her breath quickened, sensing the rising temperature of his embrace. Looking up, Lena found Jack's lips and he gave her a passionate kiss, all the while pressing himself closer against her body.
Jack pushed Lena against the window, holding her close with one arm, his free hand wandering dangerously near her exposed thighs. He teasingly ran his thumb along the edge of her dress, causing her to quiver involuntarily next to him. She responded instinctively, reaching down to cup his growing erection within his wet towelled confines. She stroked it slowly with deliberate intent.
Jack, unable to contain his passion anymore, broke their kiss, needing air.
Breathlessly, he spoke, "Do you remember our conversation last week, baby?" He asked with hesitation, fearing how Lena may react.
Lena said nothing but her cheeks flushed as red as her dress, signalling that she knew exactly what her husband was referring to. She remembered discussing her fantasies about having sex with different men, and she recalled feeling guilty afterwards. Yet, she acknowledged there were aspects of it that left her curious, particularly the concept of trying something new outside their marriage. Absent-mindedly, she continued rubbing Jack's cock through his towel. He was hard as rock, obviously aroused.
"Remember how we talked about trying... things?" he asked gingerly. Her heart raced faster as memories of their recent conversation flashed in her mind. She could feel the heat from her husband building inside her as they stood together, enveloped in the silkiness of the room.
Lena, overcome with nervous anxiety, swallowed hard. "Yes..."
He continued softly, afraid to voice his desires aloud. He didn't want to push Lena beyond her comfort zone, but the thought of another man pleasuring her intensified his longing even more. It's a strange feeling, being jealous and wanting something so not normal for a married couple.
"Let's try something tonight." He paused for a few seconds, mustering courage to ask, "Would you like to experiment, sweetheart?" He held his breath, praying for her answer.
She looked up at him with curiosity mixed with caution in her eyes. "Jack, you are so naughty," she said with a gentle and playful slap to his face.
"What kind of experiment? By experiment, do you mean having me fuck someone at your friend's party tonight?" she asked cautiously, trying to assess his seriousness and perhaps calling his bluff.
"Something new... different..." he replied carefully, trying to phrase it just right.
Lena bit her lip nervously, processing the response, still unsure.
Feeling her hot breath, he murmured into her hair, "That's why I suggested we spend the weekend here - so we can explore these desires of yours properly." He could sense her apprehension, but it only fuelled his own hunger. He nibbled playfully at her neck, eliciting a soft moan from her throat. She looked him deeply in the eyes, found the gap in his towel, and wrapped her hand around his manhood, stroking his erect cock.
"Can I be honest with you, Lena?" he asked tentatively. "Of course, Jack, you know you can tell me anything," she answered, looking straight into his eyes.
Taking a deep breath, he started explaining his feelings. "Ever since you shared your fantasies, I have been thinking about them constantly. Every time I look at you, I picture you with in bed with some man. I can't get the image of him pounding his big cock in you." His heart raced, his voice cracking as he admitted what had been consuming him this part week.
"Just so you understand - I don't expect you to actually sleep with anyone tonight. I'm not sure if I can even deal with something like that, or if I even truly want it. But, perhaps, observing you interact with someone, maybe if you flirted with him, maybe... that would allow us both to satisfy our curiosities."
"And maybe..." he continued, "If you were comfortable, you could do something, like flash him your panties or something. Maybe, I could pretend I didn't see. I don't know, but watch you from across the room." As he spoke, he let his hands fall to her sides and gently lifted the hem of her short red dress up. He lifted them just above the bottom of her thong-covered pussy and slipped his hand under.
He found her clit and slowly rubbed it with a finger. Her pussy was soaking wet, alive with desire. She moan as he rubbed and in response, she stroked his hard cock with more intent.
His face was flushed with shame as he voiced his desires, but Lena listened, frozen except for her stroking hand, as her husband painted an impossible scene. After a long pause, she finally spoke, her voice trembling.
Between moans, she whispered hoarsely, her heart hammering wildly "So you want... me to flirt... with another man... and you want to watch?"
He nodded fervently, and with a determined glint in his eye, added, "Only if you feel comfortable doing it, honey. Just give it a try."
Lena closed her eyes momentarily, processing the gravity of this situation. Despite the taboo nature of the request, she felt drawn to the thrill of acting upon her hidden desires. Releasing her hold on his cock, she slid her fingers along his wet torso.
"Alright, but no promises. Only if I am completely comfortable, agreed?" Lena negotiated with her husband, testing the waters. She wanted to ensure she could trust her boundaries, while also finding excitement in potentially stepping beyond them. This arrangement allowed her to test her limits without committing to anything drastic.
Feeling empowered by the potential excitement this scenario offered, Lena gave Jack a seductive smile. Slowly, she moved away from him, knowing full well how much he loved watching her walk. The slow sway of her hips drew his attention immediately. His gaze followed every curve, drinking in the sight of her.
The red fabric stretched tantalisingly across her rounded breast and accentuated her already enticing curves. When she bent forward to "fix" the straps of her high heels, giving him a perfect view of her derrière encased in its skimpy black lacy thong, he almost lost control.
"Do you mean flashing like this honey? If you're uncomfortable, honey, you should probably say so now," she told him earnestly, her lips pursed together in determination. "Can you really handle this?" she warned him.
As she turned back to face him, Jack saw the fire burning brightly behind her eyes. It was a reflection of her inner turmoil and perhaps even her eagerness to explore her desires. For Jack, this is starting to feel partly about satisfying his own perversion and partly about helping Lena fulfil her own needs.
"Or do you mean flashing like this?' she said as she bent forward and low this time, giving Jack full view of her cleavage and semi-covered breasts.
"Yes," Jack gulped. "You can take things slowly and see where they lead. We can stop any time," he said reassuringly.
--
The couple arrived at Brian's party a little late. After that conversation, Lena had gotten to her knees in the hotel and brazenly whipped off Jack's towel. He wanted to protest they were going to be late, but he wasn't going to refuse the offer of a blowjob. She had taken his cock into her mouth, running her wet tongue along the underside of this shaft.
With each bobbing motion, her mouth had engulfed more and more of his length until only a tiny portion remained sticking out. The sounds of her sucking had filled the room. His balls had ached and felt heavy as she worked his shaft, pulling harder with each suck. With each passing second, the intensity of her blowjob only increased.
"Jack, your cock is so hard. You're really turned on, aren't you?" she had murmured as she sucked the entirety of shaft, "Turned on by the idea of your wife flirting with some man at your friend's party."
In sync with her movements, the veins in Jack's had cock bulged, which caused him to groan audibly. He had pushed deep into her mouth one last time as he held on to her head. His need maximum satisfaction was satiated by going in as deep as possible. Feeling the pleasure mount, he had unloaded without warning into her willing mouth.
Lena had felt the warm liquid in her mouth. Her husband's load was full but she had tried not to spill a single drop. Instinctively, she had swallowed. Jack had held still for a moment, his eyes closed. The sensation of release felt so good. After awhile, he pulled his cock from her mouth, making sure to flick his cock head as it exited, in order to release every last drop into his wife's willing mouth. She had looked at him with shining eyes and he couldn't help but smile.
"That was amazing," he had said, brushing a strand of hair away from her face. "You're an incredible cocksucker. I love you so much."
Now finally at Brian's, Jack and Lena found themselves in a beautiful and lively home. In the background, the music blared. There was small crowd consisting of Jack's and Brian's work colleagues. The couple looked at each other, before soaking in the atmosphere before them.
Brian approached them, grinning widely. "Hello, you two! So glad you made it!" He extended his arm toward Lena and offered a warm embrace. Lena smiled demurely and accepted his gesture by hugging back, thus reciprocating the affectionate greeting.
As the night progressed though, with a little help from the champagne, Lena began to enjoy herself immensely. She chatted animatedly with Jack's colleagues, laughter filling the air. Jack watched her closely, occasionally catching her eye and smiling encouragement.
When it came time for the group to move to the living room, turned dance floor, Lena hesitated. Jack discreetly guided her over to one corner, close enough to observe the crowd yet far enough to remain inconspicuous.
Brian was holding court, surrounded by attractive women. Lena's gaze lingered on him gyrating to the music, observing his rhythmic hip sways to the beat. His  attraction seemed irresistible. Noticing her interest, Jack suggested, if Lena wanted to go and dance.
Jack, not one for dancing, watched her go. Nervous but excited, Lena took a deep breath and entered the dance floor alone. Influenced by the mood, the music soon picked up tempo and people became increasingly enthusiastic, dancing closer together. Lena's sensual moves matched the rhythm perfectly. As she moved gracefully through the song, the beat grew faster, the lights dimmed further, and the crowd pressed closer around her.
Jack observed the display anxiously, his heart racing, unable to tear his eyes away from his wife's tempting presence. Seeing the way others reacted to her lithe figure and the suggestiveness of her dance steps sent blood rushing to his groin.
Several times, Jack saw the black lacy thong under her dress as she danced. Every time she twisted or turned, her dress would lift up, exposing the sexy thin fabric below. He was sure the men around her also noticed.
Another song played, one with a heavy bass line that caused everyone to jump in place. Lena threw herself into the rhythm wholeheartedly, moving fluidly in time with the beat. Her breasts bounced suggestively as she moved which her little dress barely contained. The men were now openly ogling her curvaceous frame, their hungry looks unmistakable.
At this point, Lena was thoroughly enjoying herself. She was letting loose in ways she hadn't anticipated to do earlier. The music was infectious. She couldn't resist the urge to match the pace of the music with her movements. As the beat intensified, her dancing transformed into an erotic performance. Her hips swayed hypnotically, drawing the male gaze.
Boldly, seemingly from out of nowhere, Brian stepped closer, himself mesmerised by her fluid motions. Unable to contain himself, he reached out and caressed her waist. Smoothly, he pulled her close to his own body.
Lena's body responded instinctively. She melted into his arms and immediately felt the heat radiating from his skin. There was an instance electricity between them. The air was charged. She could detect the scent of his cologne mixed with alcohol. Her heartbeat quickened and her cheeks turned crimson from the sudden surge of arousal.
They continued to dance, their bodies swayed together effortlessly, the connection growing stronger with each movement. The music slowed in the background, with a romantic number, creating a sensual ambiance that enveloped them. Brian lowered his head, nuzzling her neck softly. The gentle touch ignited a spark within Lena, sending tingles throughout her entire being. She couldn't believe what was happening - here she was, in the embrace of another man, feeling his body press against hers, whilst her husband was across the room watching.
Taking advantage of the opportunity, Brian lightly brushed his fingers along her bare shoulder, eliciting a sharp intake of breath from Lena. Gripping her tightly, he pulled her even closer, his erection becoming painfully obvious beneath his clothes.
Lena gasped involuntarily, her mind spinning with thoughts of Jack's reaction. Nervously, she tried looking for Jack but Brian's big form had blocked the view. What should I do, she thought. What would Jack be thinking?
Would he approve or disapprove? These questions raced through Lena's mind as she surrendered to the passion building inside her. The combination of the intense music, the alluring surroundings, and the forbidden thrill of having another man's hands on her, all contributed to her escalating arousal.
Oh my god, another man was touching me. I want this.
Her breath caught in her throat as Brian caressed her lower back. His hands roaming ever lower and ever closer to her top of ass. Boldly, Brian squeezed her ass cheeks gently with both hands. Lena's heart raced wildly, her body jumped at the sudden action. Unconsciously, her hands snaked around his neck and she clung closer to him, not quite sure how to react to his boldness, but acutely aware of the bulge that must be his cock between them.
It felt huge and hard.
Jack stood just a few feet away across the room, witnessing everything unfold. His eyes were wide with shock and jealousy. He knew exactly what was going on, and it fuelled his desires even more.
Seeing Lena wrapped in someone else's arms drove Jack insane with jealousy. Yet he also felt powerful - powerful because he controlled her destiny. Powerful because he held the key to the secret she didn't know she kept hidden in her soul. But right now, there was something else driving him crazy... something that went beyond mere possession.
Feverishly, Jack stared at Lena's ass, which only moments before was covered by a slinky silk red dress. The hemline was now lifted as Brian grabbed her ass and gave everyone around them a glimpse of her perfect legs and derriere. Lust burned hotly within him. Watching his beloved wife entwined in another man's arms and exposed evoked strong feelings within him. Lena belonged solely to him, and no one else had a right to lay their hands upon her or look at her body that only he had a right to look at.
Jealousy! Arousal! It was a powerful mix of emotions. Seeing her in the embrace of someone else drove him mad with raging lust. However, something deeply primal stirred within him, and it was exciting. Immediately, his cock hardened and started to strain under the material of his pants.
He watched her from afar, unable or unwilling to do anything. He was lost in the heat of the moment. The was a burning hunger in his veins. Even though his mind told him to stop this insanity, his body refused to listen. His cock was now rock hard.
Drenched in sweat, hearts thumping rapidly, Lena finally pulled away from Brian, breathless and bewildered. She quickly adjusted herself and scanned the room. She found Jack and without breaking eye contact hurriedly walked towards him.
As she got close enough, Lena whispered huskily into Jack's ear. There was a hint of urgency in her voice, desperation even. "Your wife is so horny right now. As my husband, you need to do something about it."
She challenged, "You either take me home right now and fuck me good or you watch me do something I'd regret with Brian."
Without a single thought, Jack decided to proceed with option number one. They quickly left the party and as soon as they returned to their hotel, Jack was all over Lena. Ignoring the usual pleasantries, he grabbed her hand forcefully and dragged his hot wife straight to the bedroom.
Lena followed willingly, a mixture of lust and excitement running through her body, partly for her husband and partly from being aroused at the party. Reaching the bedroom, Jack aggressively pushed her onto the bed, spreading her legs wide apart. He could see and smell the wetness of her pussy through her panties. His wife was dripping wet, no doubt horny from her dance with Brian, he thought.
Jack pulled his wife's lacy black thong off, exposing her glistening pussy. Similarly, he unzipped his pants and whipped out his engorged cock. It was hard and pointed up at the ceiling. After her display on the dance floor, and her exposure to strangers, he needed to reclaim his wife.
With unbridled passion, Jack kissed Lena fiercely, grinding his hard cock against her soft core. Their lips intertwined and tongues tangled. This time, however, it wasn't merely a lovemaking session between husband and wife, Jack was determined this was a sex act full of dominance, control and assertion. Taking command, Jack grasped Lena's wrist firmly, pinning her hands above her head.
He rubbed his hard cock on her wet slit, sliding the shaft on the surface of her opening. His member was swollen with desire and his wife, equally aroused, was waiting for him to fill her up. With determination in his eyes, Jack slowly aimed his member toward Lena's moist entrance. Feeling the tip of his rock-hard cock brush against her opening, Lena let out a quiet gasp. Her inner walls clenched eagerly, almost begging for entry. Slowly, deliberately, Jack pressed forward until the very tip touched the threshold of her passage.
Lena bit her lip, her eagerness evident in her body language as she shifted restlessly underneath him. She wanted him inside her, ached for him to fill her up. The sound of laboured breathing filled the room as Lena waited impatiently for Jack to make the first thrust.
"Don't tease me. Put it in!" she gasped.
In response, Jack rammed his cock into her. It went in deep. All the way. Lena's eyes rolled back in her head. She let out a low but loud moan as she welcomed the feeling of him inside her. Jack pulled out all the way, letting his cock exit from her pussy before roughly ramming into her again forcefully.
Her walls gripped his shaft tightly, milking every inch of pleasure from the intrusion. "Yes! Oh God yes!" Lena cried out, her voice thick with lust and desire. The feeling of Jack filling her up made her wetter still, amplifying the ripples of delight rolling through her pulsating body.
Jack took complete charge; controlling her movements, dictating the rhythm of their coupling. He then lifted her legs up and held them apart as he plundered her body relentlessly. His rough handling excited Lena, her whole body responding to his dominant presence. She met his furious demands, returning the favour with equal passion. Jack seized hold of her shoulders, digging his claws into her flesh, asserting his ownership and doing whatever he wished on her.
"Tell me honey. What made you so horny?" Jack demanded.
Lena hesitated for a moment lost in the pleasure she was having but she knew what Jack wanted to hear. There was no denying him right now, as he continued to pump his cock in and out of her creaming pussy.
"Ok. Ok," Lena admitted grudgingly. In between breaths, she said to her husband, "Brian. He turned me on. So much. When we danced... Oh God, Jack, his thing... I mean his cock... felt so big." Her face was flushed with embarrassment.
Lena continued, her voice shaking. "I was scared. It was scary yet exciting. The way he was grabbing me. Grinding his thing into me. Touching me. I wasn't sure if you were angry or wanted me to let him go on."
"Did you enjoy yourself?" Jack demanded. Trying to regain some control, he rammed his cock harder into her willing cunt. "Did you like what he was doing?"
"Oh God yes! Yes I did. Oh yes." Lena replied. Her flush deepened at her husband's line of questioning as much as from the power of his thrusts. "I think I liked it too much."
"Too much?" Jack echoed cautiously.
"Yes, Jack, too much." Lena confirmed with certainty. "I could feel it, Jack. His cock I mean. It was pressed between our bodies as we danced. It felt big".
Lena continued with a devilish smile, "Bigger than yours, honey."
This statement hit Jack like a bullet. He couldn't believe what he had heard. Did Lena just say what he thought she said? Did his wife just compare Brian's cock size to his own? It was one thing to hear about her fantasies with faceless men, it was another thing to hear about someone he knew.
Perhaps it was rage, perhaps it was lust. Jack reasserted his dominance over his wife and began to move faster. His cock fucked her good, in short but rapid strokes.
"Is that true, baby?" Jack asked, his tone dangerously calm. "Did you find Brian's cock bigger than mine?"
Lena nodded nervously. She let slip several moans as Jack fucked her intensely, but her eyes never stopped searching Jack's face for any sign of anger.
He understood Lena's fascination with Brian. He was masculine. He possessed some special quality that made all women swoon. Tonight, he had witness Brian at work - dancing seductively with his wife, pressing her tightly on his cock and let's not forget his roaming hands invading her ass.
To be honest, he wasn't entirely comfortable hearing his wife admit that Brian's cock felt bigger. That only served to fuel his growing sense of inadequacy and the simmering fire beneath it. Nevertheless, Jack refused to allow these emotions to ruin his connection with Lena. Instead, he chose to focus on conquering these insecurities.
With every thrust, Jack sought to assert his ownership over his wife, prove to her that despite Brian's seemingly more impressive endowment, he alone possessed the power to satisfy her most carnal desires, both physically and mentally. Jack's confidence grew stronger as he looked into Lena's eyes, seeing her gaze turn glassy with satisfaction and desire. Knowing that Lena was enjoying this sensual battle of dominance ignited a fresh wave of lust within him.
He felt his blood boil and heart race, driven by the urge to claim his wife fully. Every muscle in his body strained, desperate to devour her completely. He growled, demanding even more from both of them.
"Oh Jack, keep going. I'm so horny. Take care of your wife. Finish what Brian started." Lena demanded breathlessly.
Jack stared at his wife with disbelief. The last thing he expected at that moment was for Lena to ask for completion of a sexual encounter initiated by another man. But here she was, begging him to finish what Brain had started.
"What did Brian start? Tell me," he asked.
"He..." Lena started, "He made me so horny! Oh, fuck Jack - don't stop. Keep fucking me! Brian... he turned me on so much on the dance floor. His touch. The feeling of his cock. If we hadn't left..." she left the sentence trailing, unsure whether to say anymore.
The hint of completing a sexual encounter brought an image to Jack's mind of his wife naked, writhing beneath another man. It simply reinforced the fact that she craved something different - something he didn't possess - even as he was fucking her.
The image alone was enough to drive him to the edge. Without warning, his cock erupted inside his wife. Cum ejaculated in spurts after spurts deep into her womb as his body involuntarily reacted to the image of Brian fucking his wife.
"Lena, I love you!" Jack exclaimed. Lena wrapped her arms tightly around her husband he came. She then wrapped her slender legs to pull him deeper inside her, making sure to arch her back to feel his cock as he ejaculated.
"I love you too," quietly she replied, but her mind was not of her husband.
She was lost with all kinds of thoughts of Brian. Not her husband, but Brian. There was something about his confidence, his skilled hands on her ass and the possibility of his large cock. What would it be like to be with such a man? How would he feel inside her? Would his big cock feel different? Would he take her the same way?
As Jack lay beside her, spent and exhausted, Lena found herself unable to stop comparing the two experiences. On one hand, there was Jack - her gentle, devoted husband who loved her deeply and cherished her in ways she could never ask for more. On the other hand, there was Brian - the masculine man whose mere presence seemed to awaken hidden desires within her.
Even, as her husband came inside her pussy, as he said he loved her, she was thinking of another man.
Thinking how his massive cock would feel buried deep inside her. How it would stretch her walls, and how her insides would clamp down around its thickness. The thought sent a thrill coursing through her veins, and a sudden heat spread throughout her core. Despite being just fucked by her husband, his seed now fertilising her womb, her thoughts drifted elsewhere.
Did she truly crave a bigger cock than her husband's?
