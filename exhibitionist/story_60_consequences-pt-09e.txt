David
"WOW!" I exclaimed looking at her figure. She was so, so, then several words came to mind most of which I couldn't say out loud so I settled for "beautiful" again, feeling colour rising to my face.
She grinned at my own discomfort and there was no doubt about it. We were well on the way to being fast friends. Her grin widened at his embarrassment. "You're so cute when you're embarrassed, what's your name?"
"I'm David."
"Hi David, I'm so glad I plucked up the courage to talk to you face to face. I am Nina."
"It's been my lucky day," I said, "will you come and see us?"
She pondered for a moment, then asked. "These ladies, I have to be sure you're not telling me a story to get me into your clutches, can I see them?"
"Of course, just give me a moment."
I didn't know why I was pleased to have been asked but somehow knew it was important if this was going to work. In the Bedroom I found Jane and Bree. "Guys I've had a bit of a surprise while I have been investigating, there's someone I want you to meet who needs our help but she wants to be sure that I am what I say. She wants to meet you on video, if you don't mind, but try not to act surprised."
They both looked very intrigued and followed me down. I went to get chairs while they went into the office. By the time I got organised, I found them chatting away like old buddies. Jane heard me sit down and turned to speak to me. "She's adorable and lovely," she said, "you're right she's like Olivia."
"Just then there was a tap on his door and Jo stepped in wearing just her shirt, I put my finger to my lips quickly and spoke into her ear, "Who does that look like?" I asked. She peered over Jane and Bree's shoulders.
"It looks like Olivia"
"It's not, her name is Nina, she lives in Jersey and she needs us. Why don't you go meet her? "
Jo slid herself on to Bree's lap, introduced herself and said, "My, you are gorgeous."
I saw Nina blush at the compliment and then her eyes widened at how little Jo was wearing and then widened even further as Bree's hand slid between Jo's legs and began fondling her, as Jo had hoped. It wasn't long before the ladies were fast friends and the conversation became naughty as my ladies wanted to know all about online sex. Nina's eyes continued to widen as Bree pushed 2 fingers inside Jo, curled them and then used her other hand to tease her clit out from its hood, Now stoking her g-spot with two fingers whilst rotating her thumb across her clit, Bree was putting on a very sexy show for Nina, and Jo was loving it, her moans, sighs, and instructions to do this, that, or just 'don't stop,' where definitely heating up the room. Jane was getting so turned on that I felt her hand slide onto my pants, then begin to rub up and down. Not satisfied with that, I felt her hand inside my shorts and then took me in hand. She turned to me and said "Shall we give her a show? See what she will be letting herself into." I was too concentrated on what she was doing to me to argue about anything.
Jane pushed her chair out back and pulled me around for the camera's best angle of view and I heard a gasp from the WhatsApp connection as Jane began to thoroughly lick me from stem to tip. The extra stimulation of Jane's action must then have set Jo off because her cries of pleasure made me turn to watch her back bend to a great climax. Jane was obviously enjoying her exhibitionism because she really ramped up the show, her hands slowly stroking me and her lips kissing and suckling my bulging cock head. Then joy of joys, Bree and Jo joined the fray stripping my trousers away, taking turns licking me and helping Jane who was now dead set on getting me into her throat.
A rustling from WhatsApp and I looked to see that Nina had pushed her panties aside and was cleverly fingering her pussy. It was shaven and as pretty as a flower, I couldn't wait to feast on that flower, I said as much to the others. They stopped what they were doing to look, much to Nina's surprise, but my ladies licked their lips to show their appreciation and that was all the incentive Nina needed to put on a full show. Off, went the panties and bra and out came her vibrating dildos. We settled in to watch, Bree closed to Jo who was intent on reciprocation and Jane sat me down, cock at full mast then settled herself on to me as deep as I could get inside her. A brief sigh of pleasure and she began to rotate her hips, her excitement intensified by what was going on around us.
This was great fun and I felt Jane finish her climax with a low moan, her body vibrating, falling back to me, then when she recovered she got up and swapped places with Bree. That was a bit of a surprise because they usually went for round two and I put it down to selflessness. But I was surprised further when Bree did the same changing places with Jo. Of course Jo being the sexy creature she is really gave me a seeing to. As well as accepting one quick climax then waiting until she was ready before increasing speed for another, she said to me "cum for me, lover" and by now I was more than happy to fill both our needs when we collapsed together breathing hard.
I heard another "WOW!" from the phone and a loud, "YOU GUYS ARE HOT!" and I hoped that she had enjoyed as much satisfaction as we had; well perhaps not as much as Jo who was always greedy. It was time to catch our breath and talk about practicalities. I could see that Nina was now very excited about coming and it wasn't long before she asked, "So when can I come?"
"Within 5 minutes of getting here probably," joked Bree.
Nina looked lost for a minute then the penny dropped and she laughed heartily before saying, "I'll hold you to that."
"Or maybe before," added Jo with a big smile then continued, "that's if we go and get her."
"That's a great idea," I say "How would you three like to take a truck to collect her and all her stuff at the same time?" None of them declined so I said "Nina, how quickly could you get all your stuff packed up?" I had jumped to conclusions of course and quickly added, "if you wanted to?"
"How long would it take you to drive up here?" She asked. We did some quick reckoning and answered, so she said, "Well that's how long it will take me and I'll start tonight; my guys will just have to wait for the fun."
"Guys?" the ladies asked, I decided to go and get coffee while she explained about her online sex and the guys who joined on the nights she was there.
When I came back, I checked first what subject they were discussing and I heard, "that sounds like fun, could we watch from the end your on?"
"As long as they can't see you I can't see why not, maybe they would like to see you anyway, an online orgy!" Then Nina asked, "So what's this special thing you have asked David for?"
Jane and Bree looked perplexed about this for a moment but eventually realised and said "Ohh it's our new friend, we met him at the bar and just clicked, David knew about him but then we went back and we were very bad because we didn't tell David and he was cross. Anyway we had some fun with him at a table out back. We like him a lot, he's not pushy, really nice looking and has a cock this big. I was just able to make out something that looked pretty sizable, just Jane's thing I thought.
"So you prefer him to David?" Nina asked slightly incredulously.
"Ohh no we love David."
"That doesn't make sense," said Nina, even Jo looked surprised.
They were quick to follow up "It's just for fun, a bit of excitement because it's very naughty, we like being naughty as long as it doesn't upset David, he is our number one and even better now that Olivia isn't making him miserable."
"Olivia?" came back the obvious question.
"Yes that's the name of his wife or ex-wife, he can't get a divorce until the shrinks have tried to make her better." We'll tell you the whole story when we see you, it will make the trip go quicker.
I decided to make my presence known then by handing out coffee and it was time to talk about the coincidences of her and Olivia.
"Nina," I said, "now you know my wife's name, I should tell you about one of two things that you might be able to help with. Strangely, it turns out that both you and Olivia come from the same town and there are some definite similarities about you." She looked interested and unconcerned so I pushed on. "Can I show you a bigger photo of her?"
She just shrugged and said, "why not?" However when I showed her the pic there was a sharp intake of breath. "I know that face," she said, "let me think for a moment." They could see by her expression the wheels turning in her mind. As they were waiting, my eyes were going from Nina and back to the photo of Olivia and I realised they were similar but not as alike as I had first thought, perhaps it was my expectations playing with my mind I decided. For several reasons, I was glad that they weren't identical, then my thoughts were broken by words from the phone. "I've got it, that's a cousin, I'm sure it is, my Mum would know for sure, we have a lot of family in that area." Then under her breath I just made out "I wonder if she is 'that'cousin" and my mind went straight to her emphasis of the word 'that.'
"That cousin?" I asked.
"Yes there was some story going around years ago, she couldn't have been more than 15 or 16. It was something to do with two boys, if I remember rightly one of them was the policeman's son and there was a right stink about it, him trying to make out it was Olivia's fault. I don't know what went on but there was a falling out and poor Olivia was right in the middle of it." She took a breath to dig deeper into her thoughts but was struggling.
"Would you mind speaking to your Mum and finding out anything you can?" I asked.
"Of course not, it's a bit late tonight but as soon as I can."
"If you can get names of anyone who was involved or might know something, it would be really helpful, all confidential of course." I added the last bit to reassure her. I was tired by then so I decided to say goodnight; just checked. "So you guys are going tomorrow, yes?"
Definitely they agreed, "she's our sex-sister already." I decided to leave that one to them to explain. As I was collecting my things, Jane came to me and asked "I think Jo should sleep with us from now on, do you mind? Is that ok?"
I smiled widely. "That's great, I am glad you two have decided."
"It's just a trial to see how we get along, she might want to be with Lauren but I doubt it. We thought we would take one step at a time but you should move into the big bed anyway, it's your house."
She stopped for a barest moment and added "Master," then winked.
"You cheeky minx I said and gave her bottom a little smack."
Jane looked back over her shoulder and raised one eyebrow. I wondered if I would get any sleep tonight but I still gave her a wicked grin back. Our eyes met and I could see more than just lust.
They weren't too long coming to bed so I was still half awake and could hear them talking in low voices.
"She seems great doesn't she?" Jo was remarking.
"Only time will tell but she does seem to be a perfect fit for us." Bree replied.
I heard them go into the bathroom together, lots of giggling as they were probably washing each other just for the fun of it because they were probably still charged up. I had laid in the middle of the bed when three soft enticing bodies slid in beside me and a hand found its way straight to my crutch.
"Is he asleep or would he like to come out to play?"
I could only think 'I am going to die of pleasure' and my cock did what all good soldiers should do when on parade, it stood up ramrod straight to attention. 'This is impossible.' I thought, 'I have become a totally sex mad human, I didn't have that much stamina before, maybe it's genetic. Early man would have had many wives and sex was probably their main occupation in between hunting. There had to be something because I'd lost count how many times my lusty ladies had seduced me today.'
***********************************************************************************************
Has Ana fallen in love
In the morning I saw them off after Jo had woken us all up in her favourite way. I felt like I hadn't been asleep at all and I suggested that they swap drivers every hour or so to have a nap. The idea was accepted the way it was intended, just me caring about them, and I waved them off after a kiss each. It was Saturday and later everyone else was around enticing me in their shirts. I managed to get Ana's attention and she acquiesced to joining me in the office. She pouted "I thought we were going upstairs, so I took her in my arms and thoroughly kissed and caressed her, by the end of which my cock wanted to go upstairs as well. As my lips descended to lick her I noticed that her vulva was already enlarged and shiny. "Ho, ho, ho, I see that someone started earlier."
"Fuck yes, it was Erika and Rachel, those girls have got so much energy and enthusiasm."
"Tell me about it," I said smiling.
Of course we took our meeting straight upstairs and I revelled at being alone with her, the centre of her attention and sensuality. She made me feel somehow as if I was the most important person in the world to her. I was sure that wasn't true but I liked it anyway. This time we made love, I savoured the opportunity to just touch and feel every part of her body, every nook and cranny, of course every erogenous zone known to me and science. She allowed me to slowly pleasure her, twisting and turning her body like a cat rubbing herself against me. It was joyous and wonderful and when we were both spent I looked into her eyes and just pressed her lips with mine to show her how much I cared for her. For a while she lay very quiet as if she needed to do a lot of thinking and I let her have her time. Then when she seemed to have reconciled her thoughts or perhaps given up on them, I said. "May I tell you how I feel right now?" For a moment she looked a little scared by the notion and I waited for it to pass. "I see that worries you, I hope not, I just wanted to say how special I think you are, you deserve to be worshipped and I consider myself honoured that we could spend this time together."
She looked at me sharply. "Do you mean that or are you leading up to something else?"
"Ohh I mean every word, I have things to talk to you about but that's not the reason I said what I did. Let me put it this way, you are so self-protective that it's hard to say nice words, you might call it soppy and that's what stops me sometimes and possibly others. Anyway I just wanted to say that, any man or woman would be honoured to have someone like you."
She looked at me searchingly, gave me a weak smile and said, "Ok, what else did you want to discuss?"
"Would you like the soppy stuff first or second?"
"Well now you're on a roll you better make it the first."
"OK here goes, Bree, Jane and maybe Jo have suggested that we have a kind of marriage to make a commitment to each other. I wanted to discuss the idea with you.
A shadow passed across her face, "I have to tell you something."
"I've been expecting the worst so shoot."
"I've met someone." Unexpected and totally surprised, my heart plunged and a hurt ran right through me. I tried to hide it by saying, "Who's the lucky man?"
"It's not a man."
"You surprise me, most of your interest outside this home has seemed to be men recently."
"I know, I met her through work."
"I see." But then thought, feeling hurt. "So why are we making love now?"
She at least had the good manners to look sheepish.
"When will you be leaving us?" I snapped.
It was her turn to look hurt. "Is that what you want David?"
"No it damn well isn't, I want you here with me but I don't want you playing games with us."
"You mean like Olivia?"
"If you want yes, and I was too stupid to see my mistakes along the way, I hold my hand up to it. I fucked up and let Olivia play games with us. Are you happy now?" I ended crossly.
"No dammit I'm not, you've been taking us for granted while you ran around trying to please her and get your rocks off watching her do stuff, don't deny it, you may not see me but I see what's going on."
"And you didn't think to put me straight?"
"Well you didn't do it for us did you?"
I hung my head, I was shamed by this woman. "Ok." I said, "guilty as charged, what's my punishment?"
She grinned sadistically. "Sentence will be reviewed and the court will be reconvened after further fucking tomorrow. "You're really not so bad for a man and I love you."
"But" I started.
She stopped me, "Let me ask you this." I waited wondering what could possibly come next. "If I married someone else or at least committed to them would you object so much if I continued living with you; with my wife."
I thought about it. "There's all kinds of changes I could do at the new place to accommodate you, I'll have to think about it but a man would require some degree of separation. That would be difficult but a woman perhaps less so dependent on her attitude."
"You'd want me to stay even if I was with someone else?"
"My first instinct would be to say, 'damn right I would' but of course I'd have jealousy issues. If you're having a mono relationship, I assume we would have to give both sides privacy. Does that seem fair? But I'll make it work if you want to stay."
She tipped her head slightly, assessing, wondering. "There's a lot of variables, I need to think. How about more fucking, then later we can talk more?"
I smiled at her ruefully. "Of course, but aren't you two-timing your new love?"
"Yes I am, but she doesn't know yet that I might keep her."
"Aha, playing your cards close to your chest." I reached out and tweaked her nipples. "Now you've started, you better put your fingers and tongue to good use, I'm ready for you." Then I grinned, "there's just one more thing" as I continued to play with both nipples now.
"Mmmmmm?" she questioned distractedly.
We have a new hottie coming to join us, by happenstance she comes from Olivia's town, they are some kind of cousin. Anyway she remembers some kind of scandal when Olivia was maybe fourteen or fifteen involving her and two boys. Knowing Olivia they were caught behind a hedge or something with one in each of her hands. So anyway, one was the policeman's son and he tried to make her out to be the villain of the piece. It sounds like a possible traumatic event to me, did she ever say anything to you?"
I'll have to think about it, let it lie there for a while. Why does it matter to you David? She's gone but you keep returning to her?"
"I know what you mean," I accepted. "Look I didn't want to tell you that I've been trying to get a divorce but the lawyers are saying that because I promised to take care of her then it wouldn't sit well with the Judge, until such time as the problem is under control or she is beyond treatment. I think what they are saying is that any signature of hers right now couldn't be trusted and until the Doc's make up their mind she can't be put under the courts protection. My man is trying to get a power of attorney appointed for her so that she can't interfere with the business or this house.
"That's not good is it?"
"Nope, I've been trying hard to shake loose from her but it keeps coming back to bite me so I've been doing all I can to get it resolved and be free."
"Does it still hurt much?"
"Yes it does but less and less each time she puts another nail in. I honestly believed it was just this demon she talks about trying to get her free from my restriction. But that can't be true because she has that freedom now, yet she still keeps digging at us like that visit while I was away. Now it's just become a battle to break free. I will always love her but my god she's making it hard even to be kind to her."
"What were you really up to while you were away, escaping from her or was it work?"
"A bit of both and something else. I've been having Zac investigated, Aleesha found out some stuff and we met in the area, there were places I could go that she couldn't that then led on to other possibilities. I am pleased to say we think we've got him now."
"Wow! you were busy."
"That's part of it, I went down to Olivia's town to do some investigating and then met Aleesha again to set some more things in progress. I was also there again because I had spotted a possible second project to follow on after this one finishes so the business side was true. Then I flew back to the Island and booked into the Hotel I stayed in on that Sunday night."
Now she was really surprised and intrigued.
"I am only telling you this so I can get inside your little pussy or maybe that tight rosebud," I said, and she gave me one of her trademark sweet innocent virgin looks so I pushed two fingers just inside to stroke her inner labia.
"Let me see, where was I?" I teased her hood back with other fingers to stroke her sensitive clitoris. I continued. "Yes that Saturday night, I fully expected Olivia to do something completely adulterous as it was the last chance her demon would probably have before she came back to reality and you have probably seen the pics and video."
She shook her head disbelieving.,"Ok I'll leave my old phone here for you to look at." Anyway, you know about her telephoning during the night etc, etc. This wasn't a surprise, I made her cum during the evening and within minutes she was back with someone else but then you know what happened next." Ana nodded. "I also expected most of you to sow some wild oats that evening but I got a shock when I woke up the following morning and no one was home. At first I was really worried about you all but then I figured that not much could happen in a place like that, beyond sex. So what was the point of worrying when there was nothing I could do. The worst thing about the feeling was being alone and not having a clue where any of you were."
"So I pulled myself together and set out to have one last good day while you guys were getting your brains fucked out." She looked at me slightly remorsefully but we had been through this too often already. "I planned to cruise along the shore taking in the sights and then have a photographer's walk around the old town." I explained in reply to her unspoken question. "What I did was just immerse myself in the atmosphere of the place, watching the people, taking in the shapes, the smells and the odd quirks of the town." She nodded understanding "It was fantastic, all my worries melted away and for once I felt escaped from Olivia's tricks and games as I now know them. I found a nice street café and sat there watching people come and go, taking photos and then this woman came to take over her shift serving at the place."
"Aha! the plot thickens." Ana said in a Holmesian tone.
"Long story short we had a night of passion, my first outside our family."
She raised an eyebrow of surprise at that "Really?" she asked.
"Yep, I only started inside the family after Olivia broke her promises to me, at least that's when I knew she was breaking our vows. Anyway, from what my lover told me I understood her to be alone bringing up a child, husband having run off with another woman." I added "She was an amazon with passion to match and I could only imagine he couldn't keep up." I laughed "When I got back home we messaged and stuff and I toyed with the idea of bringing her to join the family if you guys liked her and maybe work on the catering side once the farm was finished."
"But?"
One or two of her replies didn't seem right to me so I got in touch with a guy on the island who had been doing me a few jobs keeping an eye on Olivia and the local boys she might have been after. He took a look for me, told me she was tied up with some man. I went over to see for myself, discovered it was true, left a note and some money as an insult and came back home to get Olivia out before she did too much damage.
"Why the insult? David."
"I have been in a very dark place, and I'm afraid that anyone who crossed me has been getting well and truly shafted. As we speak Zac is being arrested and rumours are being spread through his family, friends, employers, and anyone else connected with him that he is a multiple rapist."
"Ohhh I like that," she grinned.
"I'm afraid I've been getting nasty. That Daniel, who Olivia has a thing for, will not be fathering children anytime soon and I was half expecting a visit from the police. But I expect that Olivia has sweet talked him about future sex when I'm gone, she really has it bad for Daniel, don't you think? "
"Yes, he looks very much like that boy at Uni, you know the one I told you all about, I wonder if there is something in that."
"Maybe, but she is definitely not right in the head, the list of her current transgressions is frightening, so much so that I start thinking she has made them up just to get at me."
"Could be."
"I have a whole bunch of stuff about her contacts and most should be scared shitless soon."
"I definitely won't cross you in the near future."
"Well I'll expect to fuck your new girlfriend."
"You will not!!" She overreacted, not catching my grin and then laughed when she saw I was only teasing. So I added cheekily. "This too" as I pushed in the finger that had been circling around her anus as a tease, and reminded her of who she belonged to. Then I found she opened up to me, so I added another. Then I used my mouth for something better and pushed her legs wide apart so that I could worship her with my tongue as well as my fingers. I heard her sigh happily and lay back against the pillows.
************************************
Once again temporarily satiated, I decided that we should take a break and went down to fetch my laptop. Ok I explained here's where the various items are in folders. And here's a photo of the screen I took last night of our new hottie. "Wow," she said. "There are similarities and I see what you mean, a lovely face like Olivia, that is a really pretty pussy and those boobs, she's gorgeous. Ana licked her lips salaciously and I grinned, then left her to watch as much of Olivia's smut as she could stand.
*********************************
I went down stairs and found Lauren working with Louise and Amber preparing lunch. Ruth had gone into town to get things she would be needing for a long term stay, so Rachel and Erika had volunteered to go with her and I was told she was delighted. Visions of what might happen in the many changing rooms suddenly made me feel very hot. Lauren looked at me "I know right, they will spend most of their time in the sex shops trying out new toys!"
I couldn't help grinning at her and pulling her in for a hug. "Got any time for a man today?" I asked.
"What kind of Lesbian do you think I am!" she joshed.
I put my lips near to her ear "A lesbian who is going to get fucked until she's bandy" It made her erupt and sputter and then she hit me playfully but there was a big grin on her face.
Changing the subject while Lauren was recovering her equilibrium, I said. "I've got some things to talk to you guys about. One I can tell you about together, we have a new hottie hopefully coming to join us and the others have gone to get her. If they can avoid stopping at motels too often they might be back tonight."
There was a round of laughter at that and Louise put in, "She must really be a hottie"
"I'll show you a picture later but Ana's got my laptop at the moment." There were one or two wondering looks at that last but I continued on. "It was something of a fortuitous freak accident that I found her because she turns out to come from Olivia's old town and has been giving me a clue as to what might have started Olivia's problem. Anyway you don't want to hear that side of it."
"I'd like to actually" interrupted Louise with Amber and Lauren just milliseconds behind her.
I decided to change tack slightly and tell them about my talk with Ana and I watched as their whole attitude changed, it seemed like they relaxed more as if I had taken a huge weight off their shoulders. Seeing this made me push on with the full story including offering to let them see the videos and photos if they wanted.
"I think that's the first time you have trusted us," Amber said, the others nodding agreement.
I looked at them in amazement, was that true? For a moment I couldn't think, I must have stood there like a statue. "Are you ok David?" I heard from the distance, then I snapped back.
"I'm sorry I have been having these little moments lately, the quicker I escape from Olivia's problems the better." Usually Amber would have pouted at a criticism of Olivia but now she just seemed worried. "I think I've said all I can for now but I can see I've let you all down along the way and I'm sorry about that, I will try really hard not to do that again and I'll see if we can't fix a time every evening for updates if there are any, both ways too, it shouldn't just be about what I have been doing. The long and the short is that whilst I have to apologise for being obsessed by Olivia's antics I can now see a light at the end of the tunnel to aim for, it doesn't mean you have to lose her, it's just about taking away her dominance over me."
I moved on quickly "I hope you guys like our new hottie, by sheer coincidence she comes from the same town as Olivia. I won't tell you too much about how we met, except let's just say I was running down an online lead of what Olivia was up to and their usernames are very similar. I'll leave that to you to discover from her, she is not the type to hold back I think. Her husband ran off after cleaning her out and leaving her in debt so you can see she needs us but as yet I don't know much more , so let me know if you find out anything of the juicy sexy variety. "OK now the personal stuff, you first Lauren?" I asked thinking she might be the easiest as I nodded towards the office.
**************************************************************************************
"Right I'm sure this won't affect your thinking but I am telling you because I feel we have a connection." I looked at her seeking a reaction but she just smiled and nodded. Her breasts were definitely making me feel horny covered by just a shirt so I tried to get her to sit on my lap but she refused. "Ut, Ut,Uhh," she wagged a finger, "we'll never get anything done."
Trying to look hard done by, I continued telling her about Bree and Jane.
She listened intently, then asked, "Suppose I wanted to marry someone else here or outside?"
So I gave her roughly the same I had given Ana. She seemed happy at that but followed up, "so supposing I want to bring a wife in, would you expect to come visit me?"
"Ohh that's a difficult question" I reached to touch her, "Yes, because I have feelings for you and you know I love our connection, but I guess your partner would want exclusivity."
"It's simple to you huh?"
"Nooo, there's all kinds of things to think about. Would you want to keep her separate? Where would she be if I came visiting? That's if I was allowed to of course. How would your relationship change with the others? There's a very long list for you to think about but it's made me think about how the new place should be planned to accommodate future changes. Have you found someone?"
"No I just wanted to know, things have been a bit strange lately but I think our chat today has given us a better idea of what's going on. We want to be supportive of you David but we can't if you're going off half cock."
"You don't know the half of it and I told her about Zac and one or two other things in more detail" She looked slightly stunned. So I took advantage to pull her into my arms and kissed her. It was the first time I had done that, usually there was a slow sensual game we played but what the heck I decided. When I let her go she looked slightly distracted. "I don't think I said you could do that David." She smirked, then reached forward and kissed me back, but this time I took liberties and she moaned a little. I was so relieved that I might be losing her that I rushed her up to the bedroom giving no chance to change her mind.
By the time we came down a certain part of me was feeling a bit sore, but otherwise really happy, I had a thing for Lauren that wouldn't let go. I asked Amber and Louise if we could get together a little later and they smirked knowingly,
"I want to make sure you have my full attention," I said suggestively. "Would you like me to talk to you singly or as a threesome?"
"That depends on what you want to do with us," Louise said suggestively.
"Well let's do an outline then we can take it from there later, how does that sound?"
It seemed to be acceptable so I told them about Bree and Jane and about the type of questions I had had about bringing in a permanent partner from outside.
Both girls looked a bit undecided about what to say next. I tried to help. "I'm not telling you this to get you to make a decision, I just want to get things back to the way they were and start with honesty." That hadn't done the trick so I tried one more thing. "I think that Bree and Jane have an ulterior motive as well as being true to each other," and I told them about the guy in the bar, "but keep that to yourselves please."
"How does that work with a marriage commitment?" Louise wondered.
"I think it's them compartmentalising guilt," I said, "they want something that will stop them in the future, stop naughty ideas mostly whereas right now they don't have that and they really have a thing for this guy. I thought I was going to lose them and then they walked in and asked to get married, you could have knocked me over with a feather."
More than anything else, it seemed to me that the ladies were crystalizing their own ideas about the future. I gave them a while to think and then prompted. "Any questions, ideas or reactions or would you rather wait?"
Again there was no answer. "Would it be too personal for me to ask questions of you together?"
Louise must have been in a very sassy mood because she said, "You'll be much too busy with us later to want to talk," and she gave me the naughtiest look I had ever seen on her face.
I got my revenge asking, "OK Louise, are you happy here, any complaints?"
She surprised me with a very forthright and helpful answer. "I'll be honest David, I never had any idea that I would love sex with women so much until I came here but I do miss a man sometimes. I would like to feel you more often between my legs."
My, I thought, she is being very forthright today. "Message received and understood" I said, with a wink and a smile that I hoped she would see as promising.
"Same question to you Amber but first I'm sorry about Olivia, I know you really like her and she's been hurtful."
"I won't lie, I feel really hurt that she didn't want me with her. I keep telling myself it wasn't personal."
I nodded my agreement but thought better than to speak.
"I am really happy that you came and talked to us, it was about time. I've been feeling like a bit of an outsider I suppose, but I understand that I came here for a different reason than the others and I was unlucky. I want to know whether you personally want me here, I need to feel wanted. Everyone's been very friendly but I also need to find my place within the group. And Louise has been a really good friend helping me."
I was getting a look from Louise that said, "Put this right mister."
"First of all," I said. "I really want you to be with us and I promise to make more time for you. I need both of you around me more so that we fall into things together and if you can help me with that I would really appreciate it. I will admit that I have always seen you as needing Olivia and not me, so I kind of held back. That's all changed now and I was expecting you to decide to go with Olivia or to leave for your old life. I completely understand how utterly destroying Olivia can be. I would really like to help you through it."
"I don't want to go, David, but I want to be more involved, doing things that matter."
"And on the personal side how are you feeling?"
"Ohh I'll get over it," she sighed and my heart went out to her.
It didn't fool me for one minute of course. "Don't give me that," I said, getting to my feet. I took her in my arms and for the next several seconds tried to make her feel safe and wanted."
Louise looked on with gratitude, he had done exactly what she had hoped he would say and do, she had always admired him even when she was with James and now she was trying hard not to fall for him.

David
I heard from Jane later that morning, just to let me know all was well, I could hear giggling in the background so I couldn't help wondering. I asked what was happening and she turned the phone camera on to show me Jo and Bree tickling Nina mercilessly.
"What's going on?"
"She was warned that if she didn't stop worrying about her debts we would punish her, so she's being punished, as yet she still has her clothes on but not for long if Jo gets her way." Then she added "Jo also discovered a bunch of dildo's and vibrators in her bag to bring with her. Did you know that Jo brought a toy or two? When she sees what Jo's brought she'll probably throw them away."
I laughed heartily, that sounded just like Jo, and Jane joined me laughing, before stepping somewhere private to ask. "Have you thought about her debts David?"
"I have, we have to stop the interest accruing as soon as possible. See if you can find out how much she owes will you?"
Jane agreed then asked. "Any news on your end?"
"Well I have had long 'clear the air' chats with Ana, Lauren, Amber and Louise. Just got to finish up with Amber and Louise."
"Getting sore are you?" Jane interposed.
"Yep, you've got me."
"You be gentle with our asset, it might be needed after we get back, if Jo hasn't made us all sore by then."
I laughed, "I could definitely rise to those scenes."
"I know lover, you will be getting plenty of teasing in the coming weeks that's for sure."
"I can't wait."
"How is our marriage proposal going?"
"Good, I spoke to Ana and she says she has met someone else, a woman. I also mentioned it to some of the others but didn't get any feedback."
"That news about Ana is a surprise."
"I know, me too. But she doesn't seem to have ideas of leaving, more wanting to know how an outside relationship would work within our set-up."
"It's a good question, it might be easier in our new home."
"Yes I agree, but Ana enjoys variety in her sex so I am not sure what will happen. Lauren asked a similar question but she was just being thorough I think. Neither Amber or Louise want to go, they both expressed that they wanted to be more involved and kept up to date on everything."
"I can understand that, I feel that way myself sometimes."
"I said I would try to find a way to have daily updates and I've asked them to stay closer so that we can involve them more, perhaps you and Bree can pass on stuff too when you can."
"That all sounds positive except your soreness, you take care of that," she laughed. I heard the laughter in the background turn to squeals and Jane automatically turned the phone camera to show me as she looked. It seemed to me that Jo was about to tickle Nina's pussy and it didn't look like Nina was trying too hard to get away. Jane kept the camera there for a while as Jo proceeded to take liberties and to David's eye it looked like Nina was loving every minute. His suspicions were confirmed when Jo's fingers slid inside Nina's pussy and she started massaging her inner folds and her clit with great expertise, then Nina squealed "Ohh fuck, yessss!"
David said into the phone, "looks like she's with us huh?"
"Never was there any doubt, the minute we walked through the door we knew, she's adorable, we love her already."
"That's really great, listen you probably want to get on, you have a good trip home and give me a call if you stop or send me a video of Nina being ravished. And remember I love you very much, so take care."
"I love you too," Jane said, misty eyed and properly feeling he loved her for the first time since she had joined David and Olivia.
There were voices behind me so I said, "Hold on a minute," then, "I have two people who want to see too!" He saw Jane smirk a little. "Of course they do, put them on please." He left him to it and went for coffee. When he returned, the ladies were still engrossed in the screen so he peered over their shoulders and Lauren had come in too.
***************************************************************************************
Jo's conquest of Nina finally took place in the back of the truck on the way back, Jo had been keeping her on the knife edge of orgasm for a while using knowing fingers on all the right spots and her lips pressing kisses to her neck and earlobes, her mouth and then her breasts and nipples and that was before and after they got in the truck. Drivers passing by had loved the scene and they were getting honked at every stop, particularly from truck drivers who had the better view. For Nina it was a whirlwind, these beautiful women arrived and took her by storm, no complaining was allowed or she got tickled, then she got fingered or licked depending upon the misdemeanour. She had orgasmed endless times she thought, before they even entered the truck. She decided not to tempt fate for a while but she had gone from no girl on girl, to loving it in what seemed like a flash. After a while she started getting that itch she knew when she needed attention, normally it came late, in the evening, and she'd been looking after it with her trusty toys whilst horny men watched and tried their best to orgasm with her. She had usually got what she needed, so did the men and that was good enough.
She tried to ignore her itch but couldn't stop wiggling to rub her pussy lips and sometimes her clit. Jo watched with full awareness as she judged how horny their new hottie was working herself up to. David wanted a video of her taking this girl's pussy and that was what he was going to get. Again Jo watched as Nina tried to hide that she was rubbing her pussy with the hands that she had trapped between her legs. She was waiting for her to make some kind of move that proved Nina was theirs to do what they liked with. It came when the truck took a hard turn and they were thrown together, Nina could not help herself. She kissed Jo passionately and that was Jo's signal. She drove Nina crazy, slowly removing her clothes as she teased her once again until finally she told her to kneel naked across the back. The drivers passing by would see Nina's generous breasts hanging from her as she rested her head against the window waiting. Jo took her time, fitting the strap-on, then knelt behind her, first attacking her engorged labia with her mouth, licking, and sucking on her folds, pressing her tongue into the most sensitive areas. Jane recording from the front passenger seat caught every detail like a professional.
At last Jo was satisfied that Nina couldn't stand the anticipation anymore and she began to stroke the soft outer coating of the dildo up and down Nina's pussy, whilst using her spare hand to lubricate and tease around Nina's little anal bud. Jo pressed the fake cock harder and heard Nina gasp at the invasion, her own fingers rushing to open up her lips to aid penetration. Then Jo slowed and held back some of the length to concentrate upon stroking fingers against her own clit and the sensitive areas just inside the outer lips. She carried this on at a steady rhythm whilst taking a breast with the other hand to squeeze and stroke. Nina couldn't wait to feel filled and pushed back as soon as she felt comfortable with the girth. Jo responded by pressing hips forward and pushing the dildo firmly all the way in, until Nina groaned at her limit. At the same time Jo pressed her finger into Nina's pulsing rosebud and Nina screamed with the sensory attack, rocking her hips back and forth rubbing the fake cock against her internal pleasure zone. She began to swear like a trucker, every bad word she could think of as her best climax for a long, long, time blasted through her. She shook violently for a time before she slumped forward arse in the air not caring one jot. As Jo slowly withdrew her weapon, Jane couldn't resist dangling over the seat to give that wanton pussy a damn good licking and at some point Nina cried out, "enough."
At which point Jo said "are you sure?" whilst using her fingers now inside her again.
"Please, enough."
"Jeeze, she's a wimp, what's she going to be like at her initiation?" Jo scoffed. The other two smirked knowingly then Jane went to stroke Bree who was feeling a bit left out as driver. "We'll stop soon my love" she whispered into her ear, in such a sultry way that Bree physically shivered from her tip to her toe.
