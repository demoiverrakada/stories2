------------------------------------
Life had changed. Irreversibly. After my first orgasm, something had unlocked in my brain. Now that this was an option, I didn't want to do anything else. We came 4 times that night. Each one as amazing as the last. I was splayed out on my couch, Gwen in the recliner beside me. We were both panting from the effort. Gwen broke the silence with a sigh.
"You're such a natural at this. Honestly, when we started, I thought you'd curl up in a ball and throw up out of nerves."
"I WAS nervous! But I guess... I don't know, I guess I just really needed it," I said.
"Really needed it," Gwen added.
"Really REALLY needed it," I added, with a laugh.
"Oh, I'm so proud of you!" Gwen said. "And yes, to answer your next question, we can ABSOLUTELY do this again."
"Oh thank goodness! I didn't know how to ask."
"But remember, you're doing this for YOU now. You don't need me, you don't need whats-his-face-dickhead-ex who shall forever remain nameless because I hate him. I want you to focus on you! Whatever makes you cum the hardest, fastest, and as many times as you can stand!"
"Deal!" I said with gusto!
Gwen got up and began to get dressed.
"Now, my least favorite part of the day, I have to get dressed. Because there are Cameras in the hallway."
"If there weren't cameras you would just go naked?"
"Nikki honey, if I could, I'd go everywhere naked. Bank, groceries, work, you name it."
"Oh my gosh, I can't even imagine something like that. That's crazy! I wish I could be as brave as you."
"One step at a time, girl. One step at a time." Gwen picked up her bag and made for the door.
"Wait, your box of... Uh... Toys. You almost forgot."
"Nah, those are all yours now, honey. I got plenty more where that came from. Think of it as a collection starter." Gwen opened the fridge on her way out, grabbed a Gatorade, and threw it to me.
"Make sure to stay hydrated!"
The door closed behind her, and silence filled the room. The sound of our moans, giggles, and orgasms were still ringing in my head.
As I sipped the Gatorade, I couldn't help but feel a mix of exhilaration and apprehension. Gwen's confidence and openness about her sexuality were inspiring, and I wanted to embrace that same boldness. The idea of exploring my newfound pleasure alone was both thrilling and a little intimidating.
After a few minutes, I gathered the toys Gwen had left for me and carried them to my bedroom. I marveled at the array of shapes, sizes, and colors. Each one seemed to hold a promise of new sensations. New experiences. I wanted them all, but I was also exhausted. Coming down from the euphoric glow of a multiorgasmic day, I decided that there was plenty more time tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. I slid into my pajamas and fell into bed.
I thought sleep would come quickly, but there was something wrong. Something different. This was the first time I'd put a stitch of clothing on in about 4 hours. These PJs, while normally very comfortable, now felt... Constricting. I could feel the fabric around my neck. The legs of the pants twisting around together. Was it hot in here? It feels like it's hot in here. Why is everything so itchy? It isn't normally itchy.
I tossed and turned for an hour or so. These were usually the comfiest clothes I had in the entire apartment, but compared to being naked? It was like wearing a burlap sack to bed. I kicked them off under the covers and pulled the shirt up and over my head, flashing back to earlier tonight with Gwen.
SO much better. The sheets, cool against my skin. My bed was like sleeping on frosting. Step one, Gwen had said, everything is better naked. Everything. She was right, yet again. I was asleep in seconds.
As I drifted into sleep, my mind was a swirl of new sensations and possibilities. The memories of the past days' experience were fresh and vivid, and I felt a strange excitement bubbling within me.
In my dream, I found myself standing in the middle of a bustling city square. The sun was warm on my skin, and the sky was a brilliant shade of blue. I looked down and realized, with a jolt, that I was completely naked. Not a stitch of clothing covered my body.
For a moment, panic surged through me. My heart raced, and I felt my cheeks flush with heat. People were all around me, going about their day, and I was exposed to all of them. But instead of the crippling embarrassment I expected, I felt something entirely different.
A sense of liberation washed over me. The air on my bare skin felt incredible, and the thrill of being naked in such a public place sent a rush of excitement through my body. I stood taller, shoulders back, and began to walk through the crowd.
The people around me seemed to take no notice, as if my nudity was the most natural thing in the world. As I moved through the square, I felt a growing warmth between my legs, a familiar ache of desire. My hands drifted to my breasts, my fingers teasing my nipples, sending shivers down my spine.
The dream took on a surreal quality as I continued to explore my body in public. Every touch, every caress heightened my arousal. The thrill of doing something so forbidden, so wildly inappropriate, was intoxicating. My hands slid lower, between my thighs, and I began to pleasure myself, right there in the open.
My breath came in short, sharp gasps, and I could feel the orgasm building, a tidal wave of pleasure just within reach. The people around me continued to move about, oblivious to my actions. The idea that I could be so exposed, so vulnerable, and yet so powerful, was exhilarating.
As my fingers moved faster, I felt the orgasm crash over me, intense and all-consuming. My legs trembled, and I cried out, the sound lost in the hustle and bustle of the city square. The pleasure was overwhelming, leaving me breathless and trembling.
In the aftermath, I stood there, panting, my body humming with satisfaction. I felt no shame, no embarrassment. Instead, I felt a deep, profound sense of joy and empowerment. This dream, this fantasy, was a reflection of everything I had discovered about myself.
As the dream began to fade, I held onto that feeling, that incredible sense of freedom and pleasure. When I woke, the memory of the dream was still vivid, my body tingling with residual arousal. I lay in bed for a few moments, savoring the sensations. I was wet. My pussy was on fire. I immediately plunged my fingers inside. Oh GOD it felt so good. I was frantic and fast. I was on the verge of orgasm the second I woke up, and I was ready for it. Fuck, I'm so close already, I can feel the orgasm start, approaching the peak of a hill on a roller coaster A few more thrusts, and I'll push myself over the edge, i was almost there.
"I'm cumming, I'm cumming oh FUCK!" I said to no one, but saying it out loud is so much sexier. The rush hit me like a train. I was lost in the sensations. My body was on fire, every nerve ending alight with pleasure. I was screaming with pleasure in my head, and maybe out loud too, but I couldn't tell. I didn't care. I wanted the whole world to know I was cumming.
As the orgasm subsided, I started to get my bearings once again. I had woken up and jumped immediately into an orgasm, I don't even know where I was.
Okay, bedroom.
Sunlight through the blinds, so early morning.
Alarm didn't go off, so I'm not late for work.
Check phone.
6:58 am.
My alarm starts at 7. No use in laying back down now, I guess. I got up and began my morning routine.
I stepped into the shower, the warm water cascading over my body. The scent of lavender filled the bathroom. My hands moved over my curves as I lathered. My body felt smooth and sensual. I never thought about myself like that, really. I liked the way I felt. The soap and suds flowed over my chest, letting my hands glide over my nipples, enjoying the brief sensation.
Out of the shower, I grabbed a bottle of water from my bedside table and took a long, refreshing drink. As I sipped, I took a moment to reflect on my dreams and the incredible sensations I had experienced the night before. The thought of it all sent a shiver down my spine, making me even more excited for the day ahead.
I stood in front of the mirror, appreciating my reflection. I usually only checked this mirror to see if the clothes I picked matched, but this time I took a moment to really look at myself. I applied moisturizer to my still-damp skin, ensuring every inch was pampered. My morning skincare routine included a gentle facial cleanser, toner, and a light, hydrating serum. Each step made me feel more connected to my body, embracing my newfound confidence. I looked good. No, I looked HOT.
I walked to the kitchen, my nakedness no longer feeling foreign but rather liberating. I prepared a cup of strong coffee and a light breakfast, opting for a bowl of fresh fruit and yogurt. Sitting by the window, I enjoyed my meal, the morning sun warming my skin. I felt a sense of peace and satisfaction, knowing that I was starting my day on my own terms.
When I did eventually have to get dressed, I chose something light. It was June, so I wanted something comfortable to keep cool. But in looking through my entire wardrobe, I realized how conservative it all was. I was so worried about looking powerful and professional that nothing actually looked good. All very staunch and stiff. I'd have to remind myself to ask Gwen to go shopping later on this weekend, despite my steadily growing distaste for clothing in general. I went for business casual, or as casual as I could.
I felt my morning routine begin to change, less of a rote checklist of things I need to do in order to start my day, and more of a peaceful beginning. An empowering start, to remind myself of who I am and what I deserve.
With this new change in attitude, even work felt a little bit more doable. I walked taller, with more purpose. Arriving at the office, everything seemed a bit brighter, more vivid. I walked with an assured stride, greeting my colleagues with a warmth that caught some of them off guard.
Working at a mid-level advertising agency, I get to be creative, or at the very least point things in a creative direction. I never thought of myself as assertive, but in the pitch meetings today, I found myself tossing out more and more ideas. I always wanted to be somebody who thrived in a fast-paced environment. I felt like I could actually succeed, rather than just hang on for my life.
Throughout the morning, I remained focused, or at the very least tried to, but my mind occasionally drifted back to the intense pleasure I had experienced. The realization that I could feel that way anytime I wanted to was exhilarating. Every brush of my blouse against my skin sent shivers down my spine, a constant reminder of my newfound desires. It was consistent, then it became constant. I began to count how long it had been since my last orgasm. My focus was starting to slip. My mind wanted other things to take precedence.
I found myself unable to ignore the growing urge within me. Every brush against my skin, every moment of stillness seemed to amplify my need. Any moment of quiet, my mind was filled with Gwen's moans. The feeling of my pussy being stroked. Like the other wetness between my thighs. By lunchtime, the ache had become a constant presence. There was no way I was going to get anything else done today.
I needed it. God, I needed it so badly. I began to get up and walk. Like my legs decided on their own. Am I really going to do this? Have I gone this far already? I slipped into the bathroom. There were more women than men in the building, and I couldn't stop thinking about what would happen if somebody walked in. How much trouble would I be in? Would I be fired? Would they be offended? Would they be into it? Would they want to help? Would they join me? I locked myself in a stall. Leaning against the wall, I took a deep breath, my hand sliding down my body. The thrill of doing something so forbidden in the workplace only heightened my arousal.
As I began to touch myself, images of the previous night flooded my mind--Gwen's guiding hands, the intense pleasure of each orgasm. My breath quickened, and I bit my lip to stifle a moan. My fingers moved with a desperate urgency, seeking release.
Just as I was on the brink, the bathroom door creaked open. I froze, my heart racing. Someone else had entered. I tried to stay quiet, but the need was overwhelming. I let out a whimper. I couldn't hold it. I can't stop now. I'm already so close. A voice rang out.
"Nikki? You in here?"
Oh my god, it was my manager, Olivia. Overall a nice woman, but very by the book, no-nonsense type. I can't imagine she'd take me masturbating in the bathroom as a positive thing.
"Umm... Yes? Is everything okay?" I asked, my two fingers inside me, speeding up.
"We're just about to start the lunchtime meeting. I wanted to make sure you were going to be in today."
"Oh yeah, absolutely. Be there in a sec." I basically moaned. Oh god, this was happening.
As the footsteps receded, I resumed my movements, faster and more fervent than before. Within moments, I finally came, my body trembling with the force of it.
Panting softly, I took a few moments to collect myself before stepping out of the stall. I washed my hands and splashed water on my face, trying to regain my composure. The rush of adrenaline left me feeling both invigorated and, if im honest, slightly ashamed, but I couldn't deny the satisfaction that followed. Id never felt so good. So alive. So sexy.
Returning to my desk, I felt a mix of exhilaration and caution. The rest of the afternoon was a blur of productivity, my mind occasionally drifting back to the bathroom stall, and the forbidden thrill I had experienced there. That was so bad, and unprofessional. I made a promise to myself that I would never do something that silly again.
My phone vibrated signifying a text from Gwen.
"How's the new you?"
"I just masturbated in the bathroom at work!!!"
"You did not!!!"
"I came really hard too..."
"You're going to tell me every single detail tonight!"
"Promise".
