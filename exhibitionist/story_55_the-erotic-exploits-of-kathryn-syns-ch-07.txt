Chapter 7 Dave's Lament
Dave saw Katy walking toward him wearing a powder blue, see through long lingerie with a slit up her thigh. As she became closer, it looked like she was floating on air when she walked. As her nightgown blew with a light wind exposing her long legs, she looked like a heavenly angel floating toward him.
When she stopped directly in front, she said, "Don't be sad Dave. You were the love of my life and since you told me I was a whore, I have fully embraced your aspiration of me. I thank you because I've had fantastic hot sex from so many strange horny men. You should appreciate what I've become, all because of your anger." She turned and began to float away but stopped, looked back and motioned him to follow her.
He started to walk, but then had to run to keep up with her. It seemed like an ordeal to stay with her, but she would stop and wait until he caught up. Finally he saw a black van, like the one in the parking lot just a few days earlier. She pointed at it, as she floated over it. When he finally arrived, he saw a line of guys waiting to get in. When one left, another paid a tall muscular man that looked like the guy in her apartment and went in. Then he heard what sounded like her sexy voice moaning to fuck her harder. While telling him to look inside, Katy laughed and stayed ghost like above the van. He peeked in the side window, but only could see a guy's hairy butt over a girl, as he was having sex doggy style. It didn't take long until he pulled out of her and came on her ass. Then he left.
When another guy came in, she turned to meet him. It was Katy. She motioned him closer, unzipped his pants and began sucking on his cock. When he was nice and hard, she pushed him on his back and guided his small cock into her glistening wet pussy. Then she began moving up and down on top of him. She placed her hands on the ceiling of the van and bounced trying to get him to cum. He watched her moaning in pleasure, as she continued her display of uninhibited depravity. As if she knew he was watching, she turned to look straight at the window and smiled directly at him. Then the guy began to spew cum as Katy came off of him. He watched, as her pussy was becoming drenched with squirt after squirt of his sticky white cream. As if in some horrible dream, he continued to watch one guy after another have their way with her.
Then the guy that was collecting the money came over to him and nastily said, "Well Dave, you like what Katy has become, all thanks to you. And by the way, her new name is Kathryn Syns." He gave out a healthy loud laugh.
Then it happened. He started to get a big raging hard on, watching his beloved having wild sex with all of those guys. Soon he was rubbing himself with the outrageous fucking in the van, imaging it was him having sex with Katy or as she is now called Kathryn. When he was about to explode, he smelt the sweet aroma of Katy's perfume next to him.
He looked up and there she was floating above him. She smiled and said, "I see you like watching me. Too bad all you'll ever get to do now is watch, unless you pay like the others. You once had me all to yourself and now I'm the whore you told me to become."
She laughed as she began to float away, but stopped and motioned him to follow her. As he again tried to keep up, he heard what sounded like a phone in the distance. Then it became louder. Instantly he woke up. He reached for the noise maker and said hello! He realized it was all a wet dream.
It was Tom, his FBI buddy, calling him on Sunday morning. He asked if he woke him up. Dave laughed and told him he did, but was having a nightmare about Katy. Tom laughed and asked if it had anything to do with him calling her a whore. He answered it did. Then Tom said, "Well get up! We need to talk."
"Why?" Dave question back.
Tom told him it was better to tell him in person. So they made a meeting at a coffee shop in an hour. When he hung up, Dave still had a raging hard on. He couldn't get the picture of her sitting on top of this guy looking right at him with this guy's cock implanted in her cum drenched pussy. So he did what any normal guy would. He lay back down, thought of Katy fucking all those guys and rubbed himself to explosion. Then he took a quick shower.
As he sat with Tom in the back booth sipping his coffee, he asked why he couldn't just tell him on the phone. Tom didn't laugh, but just took out a photo from a folder and asked, "So is this the guy that drove away with Katy?"
Dave looked at it and answered it was. Taking a deep breath Tom said, "Well then Dave, I'm afraid I have some disturbing news. I think you were right about Katy getting drugged or something."
A lump just entered Dave's throat, as he asked why.
Tom continued telling him about this guy. "Well he, his two brothers and their dad came over to the US 7 years ago. The dad was a Russian chemist and was allowed asylum for secret information, which none from the State Department would tell me. Since then, we suspect that they are operating a prostitution ring in 3 cities and just started setting up one here in LA around a year ago."
Dave's expression turned to anger and asked, "So what are you guys doing about it? And what does this have to do with Katy?"
Tom put his hand on Dave's shoulder and answered, "Well buddy by what you told me, I think this guy Vlad has Katy and is making her turn tricks for them. I believe that they drug the girls with something to make them willing sex slaves. We have talked to a few of their girls in other cities and they all think they are doing nothing wrong. They don't even remember having sex for money. They all thought they were on a date and wanted to have consensual sex with their guy. No money was given them. Since the girls won't cooperate and lack of real evidence, are hands are completely tied. No one seems to be talking, especially the State Department. They told us that we need proof that the girls are actually forced into prostitution and the Koskova family is involved, before they can do anything to their asset. We just don't have any actual testimony about it or have caught them drugging the girls. A month ago, agent Turner thought he had a girl named Amy Rares willing to testify about them, but she disappeared a week later. She's the only reason we know as much as we do, otherwise they are operating completely under the radar. So Dave, I really sorry for telling you this and hope I'm wrong about Katy."
Dave anger was becoming uncontrollable. He got up and yelled, "So Tom, you people are really allowing this?"
Then he walked out of the coffee shop fuming over what Tom just told him. Tom quickly followed and caught him at his car. Grabbing his shoulder, he turned him around and said, "Look Dave, calm down. I will do everything I can to help her. You just have to stay calm. I know how you feel. Have you checked to see if she has come home yet? They do allow them to lead normal lives after they have been groomed. So she just might be home waiting for a date."
Dave answered he hadn't. So at noon, they both drove over to Katy's place. As they knock on the door, there is no answer. Dave tried the door knob and it opened. Tom asked him if she usually leaves the door unlocked. Dave told him she never does because she's been afraid of intruders. Once inside, they noticed it dark and musky with a light aroma of sex. All the blinds were down and no windows were open. As Dave opened the kitchen blinds and windows, Tom walked into the bedroom. He put on a pair of blue plastic gloves and started to go through her belongings. Dave walked in and Tom threw him a pair of gloves.
Putting them on, he asked, "So what are you looking for Tom?"
Tom answered, "Anything that looks like a drug container, like a used hypo or something out of place. You should know what doesn't seem right. I just believe they use something to get the girls to become willing participants."
Dave looked around in the closest and found nothing, although it looked like she didn't spend the night. Then he saw her purse sitting on the dresser. He looked in it and found her wallet, keys and phone. He yelled at Tom that this was not at all like her to leave her phone. Tom mumbled okay and went in the kitchen. As he fumbled threw the trash, he found nothing that looked suspicious. When Dave walked back in, Tom told him that he was done and it looked like she went willing. Anger started to erupt again in Dave's persona. Ripping off the gloves he threw them toward the waste basket, but instead they went behind it.
As he was leaving, Tom bellowed, "So aren't you going to pick those up and throw them away?"
Dave snarled and rushed over to the trash basket. He moved it to one side and bent over to pick up the gloves. When he did, he saw a small clear plastic vial under it. He yelled, "Hey Tom look at this."
Tom walked over and picked up the clear cylinder. He walked over to the window and held it up. Smiling he said, "Oh yes, I think this is something we can analyze and there is still some liquid left in it. Great find Dave."
Excitedly Dave asked, "So you think that is the drug they used on Katy?"
Putting it in a small zip bag, Tom told him it could be and would tell him later what is discovered. As Tom was leaving Dave took one more look at the place, then left leaving the door unlocked. They parted ways and Dave decided to walk in the back to see if her car was still there. When he got there, it was. So he wrote her a little note and put it on the windshield that said, "Missing you. Please call me. We can work this out."
Then he went back to his car, rolled down the windows and sat for a while thinking. He was pondering about where she could be, especially if they were preparing her to be a whore, like Tom suggested. He smiled when he figured out where to go. Starting the car he whizzed off.
By the time he fought traffic and reached Hollywood, it was an hour later. He went by a few street hookers and saw this red head girl in a black mini skirt walking down the street. Quickly he pulled over and parked. He turned back to look and to his relief it wasn't Katy. Seeing him pulling over, the girl Ginger walked over to the car and said, "Hi cutie, you want some company?"
Dave smiled and answered, "Oh my, you are very sexy, but I'm looking for my sister. Have you seen this girl? I think her boyfriend has coerced into being a whore like you."
Ginger looked at the photo and noticed the resemblance to her and being hurt by his comment nastily replied, "Your sister hon, she looks like me. Are you some kind of a freak? No I haven't seen her." Quickly she stood up and walked away.
Dave was in shock. He can't image what he said to get that type of reaction. He watched her sexy body saunter up the street. Thinking this is what Katy would look like, if she was turning tricks, made him angry again. At least it was a relief knowing that she's not out walking the streets like some type of cheap tramp. He drove away wondering where else this jerk Vlad would take her. He drove to the west side of Hollywood Blvd and found a parking spot. He got out, fed the meter and began walking west.
It was around 4 pm when he approached the famous theater with all the stars hand prints cemented in. Looking at some street performers, he went over and asked the Star Wars character, if he had seen a girl like in this photo. They looked at it and showed his friend and they blurted, that it looked like Ginger a hooker, but she usually works the east side. Dave answered that he met Ginger and it wasn't her. Then one guy blurted, maybe it was that other hooker we saw earlier. Could be, his friend said. They took out their cell phone and flipped through a few photos. When a photo showed up, they showed it to Dave. He looked at a red head girl and a reddish plaid mini skirt. Her top was pulled up covering most of her face and showing her boobs. It could be Katy, but he wasn't sure. He asked if they got her name and one guy said he thinks her pimp called her Kathryn. He was shocked that was the name from his dream. Then he asked, which way they went and the guy pointed to where they had gone. As he walked away one guy yelled back to check the old Carlyle hotel, because the girls use it for doing their business. He asked where it was and they told him a couple of blocks up the street. Now he had a place, but he hoped that the girl he saw wasn't Katy. That girl had on such a short mini skirt and the one guy told him she wasn't wearing a panty, which is why they knew she was a whore.
Dave rushed up the street and found an old seedy looking Hotel with the name Carlyle written on the door. He walked in. A big burly guy named Carlos, met him and asked if he wanted a room with or without company.
Dave nastily said, "No room. I'm just looking for my sister. Here is a photo. Is she working here?"
The guy grabbed it and snarled, "This looks like Ginger but 10 years younger. No one that looks like her has ever been here."
Dave took the photo back, when an older blonde walked down the stairs and asked. "Hi there handsome, want some Company?"
Carlos answered, "No Darla, he just looking for his so called sister, but I think he's looking for something else."
Darla walked over to him, took a look at the photo and said, "Try around the corner at the Bella Hotel. They sometimes allow working girls to use the place. I would know if she was one of my girls."
Dave thanked her and as he was leaving Darla said, "But if you come back here, I'll have a young 18 year old hottie that I know you will enjoy."
Dave smiled and quickly walked to find the Bella hotel. It seemed like another hour until he found it up the street and not on Hollywood Blvd, like he thought. A bar that was right next to it had a few motorcycles parked in front. He thought, "I hope she's not here being whored out to those types of guys".
As he was walking up the street, he saw two guys dressed in military uniforms coming out. When he walked by them, he heard the big black guy say something about a girl giving them their money's worth. A pit in his stomach formed, as anxiety set in. Turning around, he quickly caught up with the guys.
"Excuse me," he blurted. The guys stopped. Dave continued, "I'm looking for a good time and I heard you mention having fun with a hooker. Could you tell me where that was?"
The guys stopped and looked at each other. The black guy Washington answered, "So you aren't a cop or anything like that?" Dave shook his head no. He smiled and said. "Well there is one working right now at the Bella Hotel over there."
He pointed to the building up the street. Dave reached for the photo and the guy suddenly became very apprehensive. Taking the photo out Dave asked, "So does she look like her?"
He showed it to both guys with Washington saying, "Oh no. This one has dark hair and homely not pretty like the photo."
Dave smiled with relief. So Murphy then said, "You should go have fun. She's very active, gives such good head and her body is fantastic. Isn't that right Wash?" Washington looked strangely at Murphy but agreed.
Then they left. Once they were out of site Murphy asked, "So Wash, why did you tell him that it wasn't the girl in the photo. You know it was."
Washington answered, "That dude wanted something else then a fuck. He had a gun in his belt and I saw it, when he went for the photo. I probably saved someone's life. You know Vlad told us that this was her first experience, so maybe he was a jilted boyfriend or something." Murphy laughed and they walked away.
Dave was so relieved that it wasn't Katy at the hotel and decided not to explore the place. It was after five and he figured one last spot before he went back to the car. Walking in the seedy looking tavern, he took a seat at the bar. He looked around at the guys watching a Lakers game and others playing pool.
The bartender came up and asked "So what will you have?"
Dave answered a gin and tonic. When he came back with his drink, he showed the bartender Katy's photo. The bartender said, "No I haven't seen her. But what's it to you?"
Dave took a sip of his drink and began to fabricate a story. He lied, "I'm a PI and the family is searching for her. She ran away last month and someone told them she might have fallen into a prostitution ring. So I've been in Hollywood all day checking things, trying to find this innocent girl. I was told that they use the Bella hotel for whoring?"
The bartender laughed and said, "Give me a hundred and I tell you what you want to know."
Dave did and the bartender told him about the Russians use the place on the weekend as a brothel, but not every weekend. They move it around to different places."
Dave smiled and replied, "Well I don't know if their daughter is mixed up with the Russians, but I can check that out. Thanks."
The bartender smiled and answered, "You know, if you check too hard they will bite."
Dave laughed, guzzled his drink and left.
One of the bikers Hawk, who earlier fucked Kathryn, walked over to Joe and asked what he wanted. Joe answered, "He was trying to find that redhead you fucked. I think he lied about checking for the girls parents. Actually she looked like the girl that Vlad had here and I'm going over to tap her cunt in a few minutes. I didn't want to miss out."
Hawk finished his beer and answered, "Well then tell Vlad some PI is looking for her."
After not finding her, it took Dave over an hour to get back to Katy's place. He was feeling good that he didn't find her in Hollywood. Turning on the TV, he went to the kitchen and took a bottle of Scotch from a cupboard. He started to drink it straight. Soon he was asleep, passed out from overindulging with booze. His mind began dreaming of Katy again. This time he followed her to a hotel, the one with the blue awning saying Bella Inn. He followed the ghost like Katy to a room in the back. She pointed for him to watch as one guy after another went in to have sex with her. He looked in. This fat old guy had her on all fours leaning on a chair, as he rammed speedily in and out of her. She moaned for him to fuck her harder, as she held onto the chair. Suddenly she turned and saw him.
Smiling she mouthed, "You like what you see?"
Dave couldn't take it and quickly left. The ghost Katy followed and got in front of him and said, "I thought you would like what I've become. You did tell me to be a whore, didn't you? You know I was at that hotel. You could have stopped me, only if you walked over there."
Dave just tried to get away. Then he heard it again; a phone ringing louder and louder. He woke and answered it.
After he said hello a voice, it was Tom. He told him to come down to his offices in LA. He had some things to discuss. When he got up, he noticed that it was already Monday morning. He slept through the night in a drunken induced stupor. Quickly he took four aspirin and rushed out.
Putting his visitors tag on, he rushed to Tom's office. Seeing Dave Tom said, "Oh good, you finally made it. Let's get to the lab before Sam goes to lunch."
Dave followed Tom to the elevators and down to the lab section of the FBI. Walking in they approach this technician. She turned around and said, "Hi Tom. I have those results for you. Who's your cute friend?"
Dave was taken back by this good looking brunette with her hair up wearing a white lab coat and golden glasses. Her ID tag said "Samantha James." Tom introduced them and then Sam starting giving the report on the vile.
"So guys it is a variety of things. First of we have some ecstasy and an unknown drug that came back as insect DNA, but not a lot of either. The big ingredient, which makes up 90% of this weird compound, is a drug K99. I didn't know what to make of it because I haven't seen it in a long time. But then I remembered reading about a compound the Russians were working on for mind control 10 years ago. This compound looks very similar to that, with some differences. The major one is potency. It is 10 times more potent than the compound I saw in the files. I guess adding those other ingredients, makes it a very powerful control drug. And before you ask, it could change an individual into craving sex with the proper inducement."
Dave looked shocked and couldn't say anything but Tom bellowed, "So what does it do to the victims, like Dave's girlfriend Katy?"
Sam took a deep breath, walked over to Dave and said, "I'm so sorry to have to tell you this and if you want to talk about it later please call me. What we know, which isn't much, is that K99 will destroy a person's ability for reasoning. It will allow suggestions to become reality and the victim will think that it's all his or hers ideas. But the reason they stopped using it was because only a small percentage of the test subjects ever responded positively to it. Something like 10% according to our report, but that was at a lower potency. The others nothing happened but making them sick. We also don't have anyone who has experienced it to talk with. They weren't even aware that they were even drugged. Even the ones that succumbed to it never realize it."
Then Tom told her the story of what they have been investigating. Sam suddenly blurted, "That's it. He perfected it with the additional elements. I wouldn't be surprised if the ecstasy allows them totally control their minds." Then she added, "But once they are controlled by this drug, there is no antidote. After 7 or less doses, they will do whatever they were directive to do. Tom! You must get his girlfriend out before it's too late."
Sam hugged Dave and whispered, "I need to tell you something about it. Can you meet me later for a drink?" Dave answered sure and Sam told him that she would text him later for the place.
Just as Dave was leaving the building, his cell rang. It was Geri on the other end. She told him that Katy called in sick because of a miscarriage and was at an Urgent Care facility in Hollywood, but is alright. She said she be in for work on Wednesday.
He went back up and got Tom. At least he knew where to find her on Wednesday, that is, if it wasn't too late. Quickly they rushed over to the clinic in Hollywood. His heart was racing as they walked in. Talking to the receptionist she told them that no one under Katy Hart has been there. Pulling out a photo of Katy the girl said, "Oh she was here, but was discharged before noon. But that wasn't her name."
Tom showed her his badge and asked for the admittance card, which she reluctantly gave it to him. Looking at it, he turned to Dave and said, "They are using Kathryn Syns as her new name, but they put her real address down."
Then Tom asked what the doctor's name that helped her. Just then Doctor Sandavoka walked out. With his Russian accent he asked what the commotion was about. Tom should him his FBI ID and they went back to the Doctor's office. Sitting down, the doctor asked what they wanted to know.
Dave was the first to talk saying, "What happened to Kathryn Syns and is she all right?"
The doctor answered giving them the details of her condition. He told him that if it wasn't for the quick thinking of her boyfriend, she probably been worst off. Tom showed him a photo of Vlad and the Doctor told them that he was the boyfriend. Then Tom asked if the boyfriend said how it happened.
Doctor took a deep breath and answered, "You know it's none of my business, but after I stopped the hemorrhaging, I cleaned her up and noticed her vagina was bruised like she had lots of sex beforehand. He told me that they were at Bella Hotel all afternoon, so I'm guessing that she was a prostitute, but she wouldn't be doing any of that for a while. I know I shouldn't make a judgment, but I do treat a lot of those girls here. So what do you want her for?"
Dave couldn't say anything but Tom saw how angry he was getting. He thanked the Doctor and they left. Once outside, Dave said, "God Dam it. I was there all afternoon yesterday and even went to that hotel. Those fuckers all lied to me. I want to go and kick some ass."
Tom stopped him and said, "We still have time. Her miscarriage gave us a chance. They wouldn't be drugging her any more or making her turn tricks for a week or two. So let's concentrate on finding her. OK!"
After they left, the doctor called Vlad and told him what he said. Vlad laughed and thought that he did just fine. He told him that he'll send over a case of the Vodka he wanted.

Dave went back to Katy's place. He had a few glasses of Scotch, when he got a text from Sam. "I need to tell you some stuff about the K99 drug. Come over to Dukes bar on Melrose in 30."
Dave not being in a driving condition, texted back, "Why don't you come to me?" He texted her the address to Katy's place.
Thirty minutes later Sam knocked on the door. Dave opened it and there stood a beautiful well-endowed sultry young woman. She looked nothing like the girl at the lab. She let her hair down and was dressed seductively with a skirt that fell 4" above her knees. Her white sweater barely hid the bra less shape of her nice breast. She no longer was wearing flats but 4" black heels. He was taken back by her good looks.
As she waited to be invited in, Dave just stared at her beauty. Finally she sensually asked, "Are you going to invite me in or just stare at me?"
Embarrassed Dave said, "I'm sorry. You just surprised me. You are very attractive Sam. Sorry for staring."
She giggled and walked in. Dave looked at her with lusty eyes and said, "Well I can offer you a drink from my bottle of Scotch or if you want something else." He laughed, "Sorry you can have Scotch from my half bottle. There isn't anything else."
They walked over to the couch, sat apart and he poured her a drink. As they sat, Sam made sure her skirt was showing him a nice side view of her thighs. She was going to open her legs wide to show him that she was bare under her skirt, but instead forced herself to cross them. As she sipped her drink, she was nervously fidgeting her crossed leg.
To break the silence that had engulfed the room she said, "I'm going to tell you something Dave that I've never told anyone before. The Bureau doesn't even know this. You have to promise not to tell anyone. I have to tell you it because it does affect your girlfriend. But sadly I want you to know that by now she is probably is a lost cause."
Dave being a little drunk said, "You mean my whore x girlfriend; the girl that cheated on me. The woman I was going to marry and now is a fucking whore. You mean her? You mean I can't help her even if I wanted too, but I don't. I just want to make those assholes that did this to her pay."
Sam looked surprised at him and asked, "So why are you trying to save her, if this is how you feel?"
"Because I love her and even though I don't want her any more, she does deserve better than being a sex slave. Don't you think?" He answered.
Sam smiled because she was there to seduce him. Giggling, she said, "So if you promise not to say anything I want to tell you a little story. It's about me and the K99 drug." Dave promised it would stay with them.
She began telling him about her and her friend Lucy. She started, "We had planned to leave on a month trip to Europe after graduating college. We were both 22. It happened 5 years ago, the last night before our trip. We decided to get a drink at the local college pub to celebrate our trip. After a few drinks, we were dancing and met a couple of guys. We told them about our upcoming trip and the guys gave us valuable information on what to see in various places. The next thing I remembered was being naked in the back of a van. Lucy was nowhere in sight. This guy, the same guy from the photo you showed me earlier, asked if I wanted sex. My mind said no, but my body was on fire wanting to be fucked. So I said sure. He took me out of the van, brought me naked into this warehouse and pulled me into a room with no windows and just a mattress on the ground. Then men started to come in and fuck me one by one. It went on all night. I fell asleep in there. When I awoke, I was in another room. That guy came in gave me some water to drink. Then the sex started all over again. I 'm guessing it went on for a week or more. I had no memory of the time."
Taking another drink from her glass, she continued her tale. "One day, he washed me up, and had me dress in a very revealing outfit. I had no bra and a sheer top, so my boobs were visible. I had on such a short skirt that didn't even cover my ass. Then I was brought into a room where I stood in the middle. A bright spot light was on me and I heard people bidding for me. Half way through the process, someone said, 'Sorry, she's off the market. I guess I was being auctioned."
Moving closer to Dave, she solemnly told him that Katy is probably going through the same thing. Then she continued her account. "I got a reprieve or I would not be here now. A few days passed and I wasn't fucked by anyone. But strangely, I started to have withdrawals wanting sex. I was brought into a room where a doctor was going to examine me. He took a blood sample and had me sitting on an examining table, but didn't strap me in. He left my sample on the tray in front of me, when he got a phone call. He took it outside. That's was when I saw some blood samples in a bookcase on the wall 10 feet in front of me. I made out that it said tainted on one of them. I quickly got up and traded my sample for it and grabbed a vial of something that was in a box next to it. I just got seated back, when the doc came back in. He finished his examination of me, putting things in my holes and giving me a complete physical. Then I was brought back to my cell.
The next day, they dressed me up in a short skirt and sheer blouse. I had on 6" platform shoes, that I couldn't walk in, and took me to see this older guy. He took me to dinner. I had to keep my legs spread wide apart during the meal. I've never been so humiliated, knowing that others were seeing my bare pussy. As degrading as it was, I was becoming horny. He had me play with myself a few times too. Anyway, I had dinner with different guys all week and every time I had to have my legs spread wide apart. These other guys also fucked me or had others fuck me afterwards. I became used to spreading my legs apart when sitting. Even right now, I have difficulty in being lady like."
Dave asked if that is why she was fidgeting her leg when she crossed it. She said it was. As she moved next to him, she put her hand on his leg and looked deeply in his eyes. She told him that she was sorry for his problem and finished telling her story. "Out of the blue, that guy showed up again and told me that I was being released. He said if I say anything to anyone, they would not only kill me, but also my family. I was dropped off in the street walker area of DC dressed in a short skirt, sheer top and stilettos. I was propositioned for sex that night and for some reason I wanted to be fucked. After a few guys paid me for sex, which I supplied in an alley, I was arrested for soliciting."
She leaned over and asked Dave to hold her. Then she whispered, "When I was released as a first time offender to my parents, it was 6 week later. They were worried about me. I didn't know what happened to Lucy and I couldn't dare tell them about what happened to me. All I said, is someone drugged us and I didn't even know what I was doing. That seemed to suffice their curiosity as well as the investigators. I never heard if they continued the investigation."
Then she kissed Dave and he backed away. "What are you doing Sam," Dave bellowed.
"I'm sorry Dave," Sam whimpered back. "But whenever I think of what happened to me, it's like their brainwashing takes over and I need to have sex. I knew I was going to tell you and why I dressed like this. If you don't make love to me, I'll have to go to a bar and get some guy to fuck me. I rather have you though. Please Dave. It's a craving I can't control. It's like the K99 is still in me. It's still controlling my urges! Please help me!"
She went to kiss him again and this time he kissed her back. He looked deep into her sad eyes and knew she was telling the truth. "Okay Sam, You are very attractive. I'll satisfy your needs, but only this once."
Smiling she kissed him again. Then he took her hand and they went into the bedroom. Quickly they undressed and lay on the bed while kissing and groping each other. She sucked his cock hard and lay on her back begging him to penetrate her needy cunt. Leaning over her, he took his small cock and rubbed it against her clit. Then sliding it down to the entrance of her vaginal, he pushed it in. As he did, he realized he needed to fuck her too. She felt amusing going into her drenched hole.
She moaned and said, "Ah Dave. I really need to be fucked. Yes! Fuck me hard Dave. Oh yes!"
Looking into her opened eyes twinkling with passion, she was panting for him to go deeper. Unfortunately, his small tool was as deep as he could go. He took her hands and held them next to her head and pushed himself as far as he could go. She responded by sighing, "Oh yes! That's it. Yes you're the perfect size. Yes! Fuck me Dave! Ah!"
He reacted by going faster into her sex craved cavern, as she pushed her pelvic up to meet his thrust. This was something that Katy never did. But Sam was being an excited woman moving with his thrusting and moaning how hot he was making her. He continued enjoying her thin body, but smaller tits then Katy, for over ten minutes. It was the longest he ever lasted when having sex. As soon as he began spilling his seed into her, Sam began having a huge orgasm. They came together. When they finished, they lie naked cuddling on the bed and fell asleep with his arms around her.

It was now Tuesday and Kathryn finally was feeling good enough to leave the guesthouse. So she put on a bikini and went to lay out by the pool with the other girls. Sheri asked her how she was feeling. Kathryn told her she was okay.
Sheri showed her a tinny scar just below the panty line and said, "You know I had the same thing happen to me. It will heal quickly and then you can go back to having fun and enjoying yourself."
Kathryn laughed and showed her small incision, then told her about having withdrawals from not having any sex. Sheri laughed and answered, "Well we all went through exactly the same thing. Isn't that right Sindy?" Sindy nodded yes.
As she continued telling Kathryn of what a great adventure it is being part of "The Manor" and "Booty Films", she left out the part of her previous life, like she had completely forgot everything about her past. Kathryn still has some memory of her past and thought it was strange that these girls couldn't remember anything even their childhood. It was all about now and enjoying sex. She continued to listen to the girls brag about their sexual conquest and how much fun they are having. As she closed her eyes, she began remembering her past and suddenly realized she had done something similar in college.
She thought, "That's why it felt so familiar."
As she was reminiscing, Vlad came over and told her it was time for her medication. They left to go back to her room. He handed her a pill and some water, which a dose of the drug was laced in it. She took it and guzzled the water. Lying down in the bed, Vlad waited until she was under. Then he put some ear phones on her and started the music. He watched for a few minutes as the directives were being bombard into her subconscious. Smiling as he left, he knew that only two more doses of Juice will make her completely under his control. But he had to wait until the weekend to give it to her. She had to be completely healed, because she would immediately want sex afterwards and have massive withdrawals if she didn't get her sexual fix. As he left for a meeting with his dad, he wondered what he would do with her for another week. Laughing he answered himself, "I'll train her into becoming an anal sex star."

Eric was in the meeting with Vlad and Mikhail. As they were sipping Vodka, Eric said, "You guys need to listen to this. It's from a girl named Sam and was taped at Kathryn's' pad. This is what she looks like."
They stared at the photo of Sam while listening to the tape of her telling Dave about the drug and how she escaped. When she finished telling him Vlad blurted, "That looks like Trixie."
Mikhail laughed and replied, "So it does son. So it does."
"Listening to that tape, she faked her blood test." Vlad laughed and continued. "She's smart little bitch. So what shall we do about it Dad?"
Mikhail wasn't smiling but answered, "Nothing right now. But we'll get her back in the stable. I'll have to give it some thought."
Vlad laughing then asked, "So what did we do with her friend Lucy."
Mikhail now chuckling said, "I had her working the rich in Manhattan for a while. Then the Turk wanted to buy her, so I sold her for I think 100K and he gave me Sindy as a replacement. What's she doing now I have no idea."
All three of them laughed and downed another glass of vodka.
