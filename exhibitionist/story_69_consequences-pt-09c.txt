Consequences 09
Part C A new obsession and can't stop an old one.
Note: AAA is my version of an online service not to be confused with AOL
Cast of Characters at End
Author's note: I feel that this Part could be put in many Categories, but it doesn't fit any particularly as it begins to deal with online webcams, forced exhibitionism and the usual array of misbehaviour. I tried the Novels category but the parts published there seemed to get lost. As usual Olivia contrives to make life interesting. So for now, it's back in Loving Wives.
****************************************
Obsession!
David had always wanted a motorbike, but his family had deterred him, saying things like, 'it's not you that we worry about, it's the idiots not paying attention and putting you in danger, you must know how easy it is to miss a bike in your side mirrors.' But his obsession with his wife's infidelity became so bad that he went out and bought a motorbike that he hid. Now instead of using it for pleasure he started following Olivia. Then finding it hard to keep her car in sight, because of the time it took to get the bike out of hiding; he bought a tracking device.
*****************************************
Online fun or maybe not
Meantime, he didn't connect to his friend on AAA for several days, then he found himself alone again and logged in expecting a few games and maybe a chat with an acquaintance or two. It was getting late without any particular interest so he decided to make a quick visit to the private room. He still couldn't understand the private language that appeared to prevail but then received an invitation from his friend.
[Hi there, it's been a while]
{Haven't seen you around}
[I've been busy, you're not my only friend ðŸ˜‰ wink]
[I get the feeling that I don't understand the language in this room}
[Perhaps not]
{So why do I have the honour of your company tonight then?}
[I don't know, perhaps because I don't have my cam on]
{Aha so I'm not one of the special friends}
[Not yet, you seem a bit straight laced.]
{Perhaps I am just shy and naÃ¯ve}
[You're in the wrong place then.]
{Probably but I liked talking to you}
[Ohhh aren't you sweet]
{Never found sweetness got me anywhere}
[You poor thing, are you a virgin? ðŸ˜Š Laugh]
{I might be, do you like virgins?}
[I like deflowering them ðŸ˜‰ wink]
{You are naughty, have you deflowered one lately?}
[So you're interested in deflowering?]
{That would be something to see}
[Maybe I'll show you something someday]
{I can't wait}
David wasn't quite sure where this conversation was going or to some extent what it was about, his chatroom naivety did not help
[We'll see or you might! ðŸ˜‰ wink]
{I live in hopes. Will you stay to chat tonight}
[Depends if my friends come]
{â˜¹ sad face}
[A woman has her needs! ðŸ˜‰ wink]
{I better leave you to it then I'm getting jealous}
[â˜¹]
{Hope you have a good evening}
David had had enough and logged out.
He decided to make a hot chocolate to help him sleep, there wasn't anyone one around, and he knew some took an early night. As he passed Olivia's room he could hear her talking, thinking there were others up, so being nosey he decided to offer them chocolate as well. He knocked on the door, the talking ended but there was no answer. He knocked again, this time he had a "who's there?"
"It's only me, just going to make chocolate. Do any of you guys want some?" And he started to open the door, it was only Olivia, she was naked sitting on the bed.
"I am so sorry."
She looked annoyed, "I didn't ask you to come in."
"Regardless of our estrangement you are still my wife and your body is hardly new to me."
"That's not the point, I am entitled to privacy"
"That's a fair point." He stood a moment looking at her body, he still found it enticing and he continued looking as she stared back at him as an intruder. The new him with backbone decided to take what he thought was his and walked in.
She struggled although she didn't shout out loud, eventually his mouth latched on her nipples and she slowed her fight, then he turned her over and took her. At last, she let out reluctant moans and this time he waited only until her orgasms took the steam out of her fight before he let out his pent up frustration harder and faster, finally letting loose deep inside her. They collapsed together face down and at last he let out a groan, her face hidden in pillows had a smirk this time. They moved only because her face felt squashed and she tipped slightly to one side so that automatically his hand took her breast, he played with it absentmindedly. The continuous caress made her respond even though she was trying not to, her bottom reacted, pushing back into him. Time had passed and he was beginning to recover and respond. This time he laid her on her back and fingered her almost ruthlessly until her body responded then he took his pleasure again. This time however she wasn't letting him have it his own way. She took her own pleasure by closing around him so that every move stroked her heightened senses.
Satisfied and feeling like a winner, she slid off the bed and headed to the bathroom. She came back refreshed, sat back on the bed, and opened her laptop. She was not going to let him think that her life revolved around him.
Becoming a silent battle he went into his bedroom and brought back his own laptop, whatever she was up to he was going to make sure he interfered. Recognising what he was up to, she placed her laptop between her legs suggesting that her cam had the best view. It stirred her competitive juices and as his eyes flicked back and forth between them, she began to stroke between her legs as if she was putting on a performance. It made her hot, the teasing implied that someone online was watching her but he was not going to react and check. The more it was making the blood rise up his neck, the more she loved it and raised the ante. Reaching over to take her vibrator and dildo, she played with herself until she could tell he might explode. She rubbed the vibrator in circles around her clit and stroked the dildo up and down between her lips, sometimes stroking it against her special spot just inside. Then finally when she was on the edge and she knew he must be too, she pushed the dildo deep inside herself to create a grand finale accompanied by a long moan of satisfaction.
******************************************************************************
They lay on the bed side by side both wondering about what just happened. She wondered what there was of him that she could still hold to, he wondered how much of that tryst involved her bad side. He wasn't going to call it her Demon anymore because it seemed like she used the word as an excuse.
"Are we talking again?" she asked.
"I am always happy if it's you Olivia but most of the time you pretend to be someone else so that you can slut around."
She didn't want to rise to that one so said, "As far as I know this is myself."
"So what would you like to talk about?"
"We haven't had a relationship since that last Saturday on vacation."
"Are you surprised, given what you did to me? Surely not?"
"But you gave us all a hall pass."
"And how did your behaviour fit your hall pass?" He reminded her then how much she stepped over the line on that occasion and the times before.
"But you know how my devil reacts in those circumstances."
"And that makes it right, how?"
"You know full well what will happen."
"I suppose, but you didn't just have affairs, as I've just said you rubbed my face in it."
"But you're here now, acting like you love me still."
"That's true I can't help that yet, but I am working on it. We were never going to have any kind of relationship if either of us is having sex outside this family and you know full well it's over every time you fuck someone else. You must have known that the first time you took Daniel or whoever came before him."
"Do you think I am having others even now?"
"Of course you are, someway or other, but I am trying not to think about it. If I have suspicions I try to shut them down, Angela tells me I have to stop thinking about our relationship in that way if I want to prevent myself having another breakdown."
"That sounds like a good thing to me, if you keep having suspicions we have no chance."
"We don't have a chance Olivia, that was gone the first time I found out about an affair you had. I am really trying just to find a day to day working relationship, but are you? or are you scheming?"
She ignored that saying, "So we are back to where we started. Are we talking?"
"Yes, we can talk but only if I don't have to face another betrayal."
"Are you using double standards again?"
"Nope, but you'll say that I do regardless or at least it's what you have coached Angela to think, so perhaps we won't talk."
"Can we have sex?"
"I shouldn't need it but it seems to happen, but it's not fair is it? There are others that don't betray me that I am growing fond of."
Olivia looked shocked. "How long has that been going on?"
He decided to use an example outside the family, "I met someone after you were screwing with those two couples."
He noticed that mention of the two couples didn't garner any form of reaction. She asked. "Are you planning to leave for her?"
"I have no plans in that way, I am waiting to see how things work out with the others, our divorce, the new home, and the newborn babies."
"I don't ever remember saying I want to leave you, I still love you."
"Just now we were arguing about betrayal and double standards, if you wanted to stay and love me there would never have been anything to discuss."
"Would you give up all the women for me?"
"I never wanted it any other way but sadly I no longer see you as wife material."
She looked at him thinking, he decided he was in a no-win situation so needed to end the subject. They had gone about as far as was possible without further conflict, so they discussed the project until Olivia began to look sleepy.
*************************************
In his office David did a lot of thinking. Being suspicious and intruding only hurt him. He needed some way to live without knowing what she said or did. He would stop following her, from now on he would concentrate on work and his ladies; perhaps going out with them instead of staying home. He would try to be cordial with Olivia and bite his tongue, he didn't think that sex was a good idea so would avoid her as much as possible.
For the next few nights he logged onto AAA, played games and increased the chat. He was beginning to get a feel for it and one or two people seemed to take an interest. He let it ride for several nights then went to the private room just long enough to show he was there before he left. A week later he repeated and then decided that was enough for now.
Angela gave him an update one evening when he took Olivia for a consultation at her home, she seemed to be positive.
Aleesha tracked down Zac but was struggling to get some good evidence, he suggested she speak to Ana to see if there was anything she could remember. David asked Aleesha whether her Techie would be able to drop anything about rape into Zac's social media and was waiting to hear.
Everything couldn't stay perfect for him, while everyone was out one weekday, he decided to get the motorcycle out to go for a ride into the countryside and beyond to the coast. The bike sounded great and was very attention grabbing but in his bike gear and helmet no one could recognise him. As he cruised through town he caught sight of Olivia's car diverting off the route to the office. He really didn't want to know where she was going but couldn't stop himself from following. In his disguise no one could have guessed he was there, at one point he rode right up beside her driver's side and she looked his way as if she knew he was there, her face growing a confused and then a worried look. He pretended to pull over then, taking out his phone, before pulling out again to follow at a distance. This could be fun he thought, she was definitely confused.
She pulled up in an established area of 2 story apartments, her car parked in the road, she took a good look around as if she knew someone was there. He was pulled up unseen in someone's driveway hoping they weren't at home. He watched as she got out and went to a ground level apartment, where she was greeted with a kiss. Quickly David ran to the side of the building making his way around checking the windows, around the back he found the windows looked in on the small living/bedroom and he hid behind a hedge watching with a sense of trepidation. Olivia was in a man's arms being thoroughly kissed, the kiss was becoming passionate as their hands explored each other like people who hadn't seen each other for a long time. They were beginning to undo clothes in the desperate way that lovers do in an illicit affair. David watched as Olivia became naked and in turn was savouring the man, eventually dropping to her knees to stroke his thighs and his bottom then his penis bringing it to its peak. Then she began to kiss and lick hungrily, and finally absorb him into her mouth sinking him to her depth.
David began to move closer, using anything to conceal although not overly concerned. The couple were totally unaware of anything as they had now changed positions so that he could finger and lick her. He was getting closer with each stage of his plan, eventually they headed for the bed and he saw Olivia's face as he entered her, one of glee that she had him and at the very same time David stood right against the window, spreading his whole body across the light. Her face changed suddenly, her sense had told her again that he was there and she had to move to look towards the window. Daniel also turned and looked, his face was one of fear and he had good reason. David had picked up a rock and he smashed it against the French window at the handle, then reached inside to open it. Daniel's panic reached a peak, he grabbed his clothes and was rushing to the door. David grabbed him by the neck and it was almost the last thing he remembered, he certainly was not going to be fathering any children in the near future.
"You have ruined my ride to the coast" he said to Olivia. Then he had an idea, he dragged her to his bike and sat her on the back, stark naked. He put his spare helmet on her head but kept her face cover open. He jumped on, powered up and headed out for the sea. All along the way everyone noticed truck drivers blaring their horns as well as every other kind of vehicle, whistles were blown and every time they stopped David moved to make her visible. Everywhere they went he made her look like a whore or a slut, at least that was what he was trying to do. All she could do was cling to his body trying to hide, it was cold and uncomfortable and immensely disgraceful and shaming.
He became bored after a while and turned towards home, where Bree was in. He asked her to help pack Olivia's clothes and essentials, while she rushed to dress. He threw everything into his car including Olivia into the back, Bree insisted on coming too. David pulled up outside the apartment and asked Bree to lead Olivia inside while he collected the clothes. Inside there was no sign of Daniel and he searched for the identity of the owner without success, there was only minimum amenities and no clothes. David telephoned a glazier to fix what he had broken. "So much for you not wanting to leave and still loving me," he scoffed. Bree finally asked what happened and he gave her a detailed description. Are you ok she asked? I don't know, I was going to take a ride out on my new bike to the farm and the coast to take it easy. And then I saw her car turning nowhere near where she was supposed to be. I wished I didn't follow but she wanted us to be talking again, she said she loved me and I like a sap, wanted to believe she was making an effort even if she never really loved me. She was lying again of course so it was the final, final, resort. David spotted Olivia's car keys, would you make sure she has what she needs and then drive home. He picked up her phone and pocketed it then checked through the clothes she had been wearing when she first arrived, found her purse, and removed everything. He then went out to her car and checked its contents. He went back to the apartment and went through it for anything dangerous, finally he rang Angela's office and left a message to ring him back.
Bree and David sat in his car outside and she questioned him about what he planned for Olivia. "For the second time I am throwing her out but this is the last time and it's up to her to look after herself from now on. We will leave her enough cash to eat and over the next few days I will begin splitting our assets. I've already put everything in trust so she can't break anything up but she will get a share of the income. I don't know who's apartment this is but perhaps you will organise it for me."
Bree was a lot happier to know that he was making provision for Olivia so she agreed to help her through the next few days until all ties were broken. She looked at him trying to judge how he truly felt, all he would say was there has to be consequences. Eventually Angela rang and promised to come as soon as she could, so they sat talking until she arrived. Angela looked like a woman who failed, which she had, just a few days earlier she had told him that Olivia was doing well. He told her what was happening and left her with Bree, and the two women went into the apartment, David finally gave way and cried, eventually falling to his knees in the street and Olivia stood in the Kitchen watching. Angela stepped into the Kitchen and watched what was happening. She was completely devastated by her inability to help.
When David finally reached home, he began contacting every person who had communicated with her for whatever reason, a standard communication said that she was not to be contacted under any circumstances, any matter relating to business shall be to the office and otherwise to himself. He made up a warning that said. 'Any prior or subsequent contact without her husband's consent will be taken as a contributing attempt to break their marriage and he will take appropriate action, legal processes are already being prepared to place information of activities on social media, with employers, relatives, and friends.'
Any reservation he had had was forgotten and he focussed harsher communication on anyone connected with a sexual or perverted act, making a note on anything he could use for sending to connections, if they could be identified, which he doubted. He found all kinds of connections on the likes of AAA and other organisations and spent hours sending the companies suitable warnings as appropriate. He was determined that there would be consequences and he became obsessed with the task. Eventually all his ladies came in as one and took him out and held him together, trying to give him the love to make up for what had happened.
The ladies made sure that he would hear nothing more of Olivia, whilst Jane, Ana, and Bree took it upon themselves to make sure Olivia was as ok as they could. He spoke to his family at last and they were devastated, Michael too took over anything that was needed. David was left with a trip to Olivia's family and he felt duty bound to do it but took Bree and Jane with him. One thing that struck him was a sense of guilt from the parents. Olivia had always said they gave her freedom when she was young and their faces showed that they wondered if they had been responsible in some way. He was pleasantly surprised that they were prepared to come back with him to talk to Angela and visit Olivia and they were in a hurry to do so. David had accommodation booked so they sent the family onwards and made arrangements with the others to meet them on arrival and arrange for a meeting with Angela.
There was such a sense of relief between David, Jane and Bree that they almost felt joy. They spent their day exploring the area and taking in the Real Estate. The farm development back home was underway but there was a sense of sadness over-riding the adventure, he was starting to wonder what their next adventure might be.
******************************************************************************
A New Life
David
The next big change in my life began with an appointment to see Jeff Hayden, a Lawyer, to discuss my divorce. It would be well timed to coincide with the new Retreat being finished. People might not think it had anything to do with my sanity but if it didn't happen quickly, I was sure I'd go mad.
It's never fun to visit a lawyer but divorce must be the worst reason to want to. I explained that my wife has been unfaithful on multiple occasions but the case is complicated by my ex-wife's psychological problem which probably caused the problem in the first place.
"It's not necessarily a good time to file for a divorce," Jeff says, "a judge might view your wife as not being of sound mind."
"I understand but I need to continue the life we built before her problem and her illness is a major distraction from day to day work and could possibly prevent me from making important decisions."
"Is it that she won't assist or is she unable?"
"Mostly it's because I don't want to communicate with her directly, she is lucid a lot of the time but under certain circumstances she loses focus and common sense, that's when she does things that have caused our divorce. I can't handle those times and I certainly can't believe what she says then. The problem has always been knowing when she's herself or when she's someone who lies, twists words and can't accept the truth. Think of her as schizophrenic."
"You have already set up Trusts to handle your interests, have you not? So in order to be seen as whiter than white I would recommend that she nominates a 'power of attorney' and you postpone the application for divorce until the psychologist confirms either she has recovered or there is no expectation of a future recovery."
"Can't the Psychologist say the latter now, Olivia has been seeing Angela the psychologist for some time now."
"I have made initial contact with Angela and she is saying that the parents are offering important help and the investigation is still active." Said Jeff.
"Yes I initiated those actions, but I feel like we have been around and around every possibility of recovery so many times and each time I suffer." Agreed David.
"Unfortunately, Angela says that Olivia claims that you made a pledge not to divorce her because of her problem, that will not look right for you if there is a dispute." Advised Jeff.
"I did, but I will claim that she was in her right mind when I caught them last week in the process of an affair, there had to have been a good deal of preconceived arranging." David argued.
"I will take that up with Angela, it does seem significant and you do have my full sympathy. My opinion is that you should completely cut ties and put the divorce on hold until I tell you that we have what we need." Jeff suggested.
"But what if her nominee starts interfering in the business?" David worried.
"I don't think that will be possible in respect of day to day matters unless you do something that is significantly against the interest of the business. Don't forget the nominee is there only to sign off on decisions that require both trustees." Said Jeff, trying to ease his fears, then asked. "Do you have any issues in the pipeline that will fall into that bracket? And is Olivia still working for your firm?"
"She goes into the office to keep up with her own workload, I have no issue with that and now that we have Michael with us she doesn't need to interact with me, thankfully. As far as I know there are no major issues in the pipeline and we have made sure the development is completely separate. That Trust Company is effectively a client of the Architectural and Design business. I'm not doing much personally at the moment for the business, my associates, good friends and family have gathered their support for a while and I am fully committed to the big development that's keeping my mind occupied"
Jeff nods his understanding.
David's phone buzzes. "Excuse me a second."
He sees that it is a message from Jane and Bree.
'We are going to the Sports bar.'
'OK I'll see you there, be careful with all those rampant businessmen ðŸ˜Š smiley'
Jeff and David go over a few more details about his intentions for the house when the new development is finished and they call it a day.
******************************************************************************
Leaving the lawyers office, David's mind is distracted by his plans and the issues that might become relevant in the future if Olivia becomes an issue. He wanders for a good while before entering the bar, it seems very busy, a lot of city business people are all there for a lunchtime drink. He is not concerned as the ladies aren't alone and this is a safe environment. He walks around checking all the booths and people standing away from the bar, drinks in hand, not finding them he decides to wait at the bar for a drink. It's not a good spot because the barmen are both serving centrally but it enables him to grab a stool while he is waiting. He keeps an eye on the staff until he catches an eye and can order, then turns to survey the room through gaps in the crowd. Eventually he spots Jane then Bree in a large group.
Messaging Jane 'I am here, just spotted you in a group, are u OK?'
He sees Jane scan the room then catch his eye. She gives him a devilish grin then reaches to touch the nearest man who responds by touching her back and giving her an interested smile.
''Naughty girl ðŸ˜‰ wink' he sends.
Jane turns to Bree and shows her the messages, he messages Bree too "Are you OK?"
Bree blows him a kiss then sends him a wink message.
He watches for a while as they flirt shamelessly.
Getting bored he decides to stir up the messages both at once so he creates a group: 'Anyone taken your interest?' ðŸ˜‰ wink.
'No one yet big enough for the job' comes back from Jane.
'Are you jealous?' Bree asks.
'Doesn't look like anyone's good enough to make me jealous'
Later 'I can see one who could fly a flag' writes Bree.
He watches as Jane moves close to Bree to get the same view.
'He is quite handsome too' writes Jane after a long look; noticed by the man himself.
The ladies go into a huddle to chat and meanwhile the man slowly sidles around to them. David thinks 'they are in trouble now if they don't want it to go further' He surprises them when the man goes close and moves into their huddle. Both ladies respond seemingly surprised, but they continue a conversation and David gets bored again.
'Where's your chat going?' David asks.
One of them must have asked if he had to go back to work. 'Not long now, think he wants to make a date'
'Make sure he knows about me then it's up to you.'
'I think he wants us both David.'
'I am sure he does but your mine and I'm not finished with you ðŸ˜‰ wink'
David decided to try to distract them from this man. 'How do you fancy a visit to a club tonight? Us three, then a night in a hotel, and tomorrow is yours if you can still walk ðŸ˜Š laugh.'
It looks as if they are coming to me and the man looks worried, he offers his phone. Jane stops and I assume she enters a phone number.
They come to me and the man looks disappointed. They ask, "What are you up to David?"
"And what are you up to?" I retort with a cheeky grin. "Let's find a quieter spot to chat."
They move away from the hubbub of the bar area.
I suggest, "If you would like, we can go to the hotel where I went for the conference."
"Are you sure that this is not revenge against Olivia?"
"The idea came to me when I was watching you flirt, I'm trying to distract you from that guy."
"Distract some more then." Says Bree and Jane adds "Do we have to go anywhere?"
"How about distracting me?" He says suggestively.
The ladies look happier about that and David decides he wants to take them home and ravish their bodies, they agree with a look that says, 'What takes you so long?'
Much, much later he is lying in a mental fog surrounded by their gorgeousness. He spots Olivia's laptop sitting on the side, 'I must remember to wipe it,' he thinks. 'Might as well send it back to her'.
They hear the others arriving home and he decides he would like to molest Bree and Jane one last time before they get pounced on, of course it takes far too long and soon several additional bodies join them. David crawls out from under, grabs the laptop and heads downstairs to put coffee on. The computer is locked so he takes it into his office and takes it apart to remove the hard drive and clone it. As he is doing it he realises that he has an obsession of finding out what she is doing. A few minutes and the hard drive is in a reader. Checking through there isn't much except the site visit history, some photographs of people received, then usernames and passwords from the web browser. Olivia appears to have kept her laptop as clean as possible and he wondered whether she thought he was checking up on her. This realisation made him even more inquisitive, so he made a copy, then restored the machine.
He sent Angela a message saying that he had taken Olivia's laptop and phone to prevent her doing anything silly in respect of her contacts but he thought she should be the decision maker of whether he should return them.
Surprisingly, she came back to him quickly and said that he should return everything now that he has commenced divorce proceedings.
He replied that he was putting the proceedings on hold now that he had time to get over what she did. 'At the moment I am just concerned that you get her well, beyond any doubt if that's possible'.
'I am glad to hear it, I can understand your initial reactions. Please don't hesitate to contact me if I can help in any way.'
He replied, 'I am getting on with my life and she's in your hands until she tries to make my life hell again. You can advise her that it's OK to go into the office to continue her work, I will be working from home short term and will also arrange for someone to let me know when she is in the office'
During dinner, David asked for a volunteer to return Olivia's Laptop and Phone and anything else left behind. Erika and Rachel volunteered to go after dinner.
Later that night David logged into AAA again, spent some time on the games, hovered around in chat rooms and spent just a short while checking out the private area to see who was there. He made a note of the usernames to see if any tallied with the list he had from Olivia's laptop and phone.
Very late, possibly around one in the morning David is woken by his phone, it's a message asking to be on Olivia's friend list and he is quickly broken from his half sleep. Before he had even thought it through he accepted.
'Hi David' came soon after.
'Hi Olivia, can't you sleep?'
'No, I am lonely.'
'Is there no one to keep you company?'
'No I've lost everyone.'
'Are you lonely every night? '
'Yes, thank you for sending my phone and laptop back.'
"If you need anything I'll make sure you get it.'
'Thank you, I miss you.'
'I hope you get better.'
'I am trying to.'
'Do you know when you're not?'
'I suppose not, the first time I know is when I'm in trouble with you. Have you left me forever?'
'I was going to divorce you but I am feeling better today, I guess that's why I am talking to you now.'
'I'm sorry David, I never wanted to lose you.'
'It's easy to believe that now, not so easy when you've done something bad.'
'I know, I'm sorry."
'If I offer to ask the others to hug you to sleep sometimes, will you go to sleep now?'
'Would you, I'd like to try please.'
'The others might only come when you're not messing around.'
'I might not feel so empty and alone.'
'I will ask them in the morning. Just leave a note on your messenger when you have company or you are alone. Otherwise people can drop by when they can.'
'I would like that'
'You can start going into the office regularly. I'll get your car back to you tomorrow.'
'Yes please, I'm bored.'
'And how does your demon feel now that there is no one to care?'
'Don't you care anymore?'
'I try not to, it's easy not to when I feel betrayed and hurt. I've been taking it out on as many people as I can, who have done something wrong'
'I care about you. I know you won't believe me.'
'Ring me and tell me that the next time you are with someone else.'
'I don't want there to be someone else.'
'You mean it now but let me know when your needs have taken over, just don't do it like you did on holiday. I don't want to know or care what you're doing, just ask your demon to send me a message telling me that you care, let's see how you deal with that one.
'I will try.'
'OK, do you think you can sleep now?'
'Tell me something nice to help me feel better.'
'I still love my Olivia.'
'Good night my love.'
'Good night Olivia.'
David was awake now and needed something else to think about so he logged onto AAA. A sixth sense told him to log into the private chat room. Not long after that, his friend messaged him.
'Hello there'
'Hi stranger, have you been busy?'
'I had computer problems, looking forward to meeting with my friends again.'
'Will it be a hot night then?'
'Maybe, depends who is here'
He noted the identities as other people connected to his friend.
'Looks like it could be a busy one.'
ðŸ˜Š smiley
'In that case I will leave you to it'
Nothing came back for a very long time and he assumed that his friend was greeting other friends. He eventually got a 'Nite' back and felt somehow that he was unimportant, he didn't want to come back ever again. Something inside wanted to see who it was and it was making him denigrate himself, it was just the suspicion that it was Olivia. Tomorrow he would investigate her computer back-up further and see if he could find her AAA identification.
Then a message came on his phone, 'I care about you.'
He wrote several messages in reply but deleted them all because each would be based on assumptions. Then finally he wrote, 'Your SLUT side came quick. Hope you sleep better eventually,' and then he tried to not to care so that he could sleep.
In the morning David was extremely relieved that many of the ladies offered to spend time with Olivia so he wouldn't need to care again. He told the office that Olivia would be going into work again but to let him know if there were any issues or if she was scheduled to be out. He also arranged for Erika and Rachel to take her car over. Then he was determined not to think about her again for as long as possible.
As the days went by he was beginning to get into some kind of routine that made him feel more settled. His relationship with Jane and Bree was growing and they moved into the same bedroom with visitations from others, Erika and Rachel were often with him and Jo of course. He was intimate with all of the ladies at least every other day during weekdays, sometimes more often and definitely at weekends. His relationship with Lauren was strangest of all, it was as if she cared but was determined not to; but the sex was always hot, he adored her body. Ana's relationship had become the strangest, he had felt very close to her during parts of their vacation but now she appeared cautious. He decided to let her find her own way but would make sure he was there for her.
Olivia insisted on messaging him at least twice a day before one of the ladies arrived, and if she was alone then he would sometimes get a 'I care for you' message. At first he wouldn't ask what she was doing but he was deciding what he would say next time, probably something straight to the point might be appropriate.
The Farm and Leisure centre was moving forward at speed and he was spending more and more time on site. The next time David decided to go into the office, Jane and Bree asked to go with him. He knew why but didn't push for a reason. At lunch time, he finished up what he was doing and made his way to the same bar and found himself a corner of the bar as before. This time there were even more people so his view of the room was much reduced at the beginning and he had no idea if they were there. Being lonely he decided to log on and play some games on his phone, then he received a 'care for' message to which he sent the reply he intended 'thank you, what are you doing?' and no reply came.
As the crowd thinned he spotted Bree and Jane in a dark area at the back, sitting closely either side of their man, Ash. David didn't let them know he was there, just watched their arms moving which indicated their hands were under the table doing something naughty and the man seemed to be reciprocating. Do I let them know I am there? He wondered but he decided not to and left as soon as he knew. Once he was outside, the devil in him sent a message saying 'I'm planning to leave soon' but no reply came; all he could do was wait nearby to watch for them.
He could have felt guilty when they came out but they hadn't been honest so he didn't feel any remorse. Not a lot was said on the way home, except "You were done quick David", to which he replied, "You didn't say what you were doing so I assumed you would be ready, sorry if I interfered with your shopping, you didn't reply or I would have met you in the bar." In his current mood he thoroughly enjoyed the interaction. He made it worse for them by dragging the day out further, detouring off to deliver a package to Olivia whom he also hoped to interrupt.
She took a long time to open the door and didn't invite them in so he encouraged the ladies into extended conversation while he pretended to go around back. When he turned around Olivia had disappeared inside and when she came back he gave her a look that said, 'I know just what you are up to,' with a suitable look to the heavens. They said goodbye heading down the drive and Olivia went in quickly, as soon as the door closed he shot around the back and sneaked a look, two youngish looking men were coming out of the bathroom. As they joined Olivia, he went and waved to them, making sure he was seen, and then left.
Jane and Bree were full of questions, but what could he say without seeming nasty, so he said he was wondering if he had left something there last time he visited. They turned and drove home then he sent Angela a message telling her what he had discovered. Finishing with a sarcastic comment 'she seems to be progressing doesn't she!' One more time he is determined to try to forget Olivia.
