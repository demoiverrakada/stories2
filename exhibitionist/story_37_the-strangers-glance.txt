My heart pounded with excitement as the roar of the engine signaled his arrival. The sound sent shivers down my spine, a sensation that seemed to take over whenever he was close. I quickly grabbed my leather jacket and took a quick look in the mirror, admiring how my gray eyes contrasted with my tousled black hair that cascaded down onto my shoulders and back.
My top was sleeveless, a deep V-neckline flattering my breasts as it showcased just a hint of cleavage. The top clung to my slim waist, emphasizing my hourglass figure. My red plaid skirt skimmed just above my knees, exposing my toned legs. If I bent forward or to the sides, my most intimate area would be exposed for all to see because I only wore thongs beneath it, which provided little protection from prying eyes.
As I zipped up my jacket, feeling the fabric press against my breasts, I felt a surge of confidence that came with knowing I looked attractive. My nipples were especially sensitive because I wasn't wearing a bra, and as they hardened, I took a deep breath and dashed out the door, sending shockwaves through the silence as my black pumps clacked wildly against each step.
My heart rate increased as I approached the gleaming white VW Passat parked outside my dorm. My boyfriend's obsession with his car was out of this world, as if it were a part of his personality. He spent hours polishing and tinkering with every detail, and he was always eager to show it off to anyone who would listen. It was clear that the car his father had bought him for his birthday was his pride and joy, and I learned to accept his enthusiasm for it.
The curve of my boyfriend's broad shoulders shifted as he moved from the driver's side and headed towards me; that wild grin on his face was enough to drive me insane. Even though it was an unusually warm late autumn evening, a shiver ran down my spine as a whisper of a breeze made its way around me, yet the mere sight of David lit me up from the inside with an intense and inexplicable desire.
"Good evening, gorgeous," David said, his voice low and smooth.
I could feel my face heating up like it was on fire as I melted under the weight of his words. With each breath, he seemed to draw me in even more, and it was only a matter of time before I ran right into his arms--but alas, we were standing right at the entrance of my dormitory, where there seemed to be multiple pairs of eyes eagerly peering through the windows just above us; they belonged to none other than my rather nosy and intrusive roommate, who was always gossiping about something. To make matters worse, our parents were known acquaintances, and I wasn't allowed to date, so I told her he was my chemistry tutor, despite the fact that he never attended college.
I knew I had to be cautious, but it was becoming increasingly difficult to resist David's endearing smile and undeniable charisma. My desire to pursue a relationship with him was at odds with my fear of the consequences if my lie were discovered, because my father made it abundantly clear that the only reason I should attend college was to obtain a degree and he emphasized that there was no room for anything else, particularly boys. He also wouldn't have approved of David because I was only 19 and he was 21, both of us without a steady job or any prospects for a future together; we didn't share any interests and would almost certainly end up breaking each other's hearts--all facts I chose to ignore because he was just so incredibly attractive, and his impressive package more than compensated for anything else lacking.
David held my gaze as we stood together, our bodies close but not touching. A fire burned in his eyes, and I knew in an instant that he wanted me as much as I wanted him. The electricity between us was palpable; it crackled in the air like a live wire and amplified every sensation on my skin. This date had been months in the making--an intense exchange of flirting that ignited sparks between us right away and led to us having sex every time we saw each other--and tonight would be no exception.
As we had agreed, David opened the passenger door without touching or kissing me like a true gentleman, but the raw desire in his gaze as I got into the car was anything but innocent. My heart was pounding as he slid into the driver's seat and turned to face me, placing his hand on my thigh. The tension between us was almost unbearable--I knew that I was in for a wild ride, and I couldn't wait to see where the night would take us.
As we drove down the darkened streets, the chemistry between us grew stronger with each passing moment. His gaze kept lingering over me, and his fingers moved lightly along my thigh like a ticking time bomb waiting to explode with passion. Under his intense gaze, I shifted slightly in my seat and felt a rush of excitement wash over me, making me tingle all over.
His fingertips grazed the skin, feather-light and lingering, leaving a tantalizing trail of pleasure as he moved slowly towards my inner thigh. My breath caught in my throat, and I couldn't stop wondering about his next move, a nervous excitement coursing through me. It was as if I were being lifted higher and higher in a spiral of pleasure until all coherent thought faded away into pure longing. My body craved his touch, and every nerve in my body twitched in anticipation of the pleasure that was about to come as I gave in to the intense desire, losing myself in the moment until nothing else seemed to exist but his touch.
The engine roared as we sped through the quiet streets, and I could see my boyfriend's excitement growing. I reached over and put my hand on his lap, teasing his growing erection as we scoured the dimly lit back alleys and deserted parking lots, looking for a secluded spot to let loose. We couldn't go back to my dorm, and David lived with his father, so sex in his car was our only option.
We didn't speak a word while driving, but the sexual tension between us burned like wildfire. I could feel his excitement raging inside of him in accordance with the car's engine revving. I knew we were both craving a release, and I couldn't wait to feel his hands all over me as we finally found our secret spot to fulfill our desires, hidden from prying eyes and the city's watchful gaze.
As we made our way to our secluded spot, the air crackled with excitement, and my heart pounded, every beat echoing in my ears. The thrill of doing something forbidden only heightened the rush coursing through my veins.
All bets were off once we parked, and I could feel an uncontrollable heat blooming inside me. David's dark eyes were filled with hunger and lust as he watched me, waiting for me to make the first move. I couldn't resist and pressed my lips to his, feeling his hands grip my waist firmly as electricity surged through me. His scent, a tantalizing blend of spices and musk, intoxicated me as my body pressed against his, making it impossible for me to pull away. It was a scent that lingered in my mind long after we had broken up, but it didn't remind me of David; instead, it vividly reminded me of what had happened later that night at his house.
We kissed fervently, our bodies yielding to each other as the world around us faded away, leaving only the heat of our passion and the sound of our breathless moans. We didn't care who saw us; nothing else mattered at the time except the intense connection we shared.
As David drew away, he left a trail of warmth on my tingling lips. I was flushed and out of breath, as if I had been running, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of longing for him. The realization that I had fallen hard for him hit me, even though I knew our relationship was purely physical. At that age, all I cared about was the moment we were in and the electric chemistry that pulsed between us. I knew that David was bad for me, but I couldn't resist the temptation. Our secret trysts had become addictive, and I was willing to risk it all for the thrill of being near him.
"I'll sit in the back," David said, his voice a hoarse whisper of desire.
He had to step out of the car to get into the back seat because of his tall, muscular body. Once he settled in, I kicked off my pumps, climbed into the back seat with my petite frame, and straddled him, wrapping my arms around his neck. Heat radiated between us as our bodies pressed together, and I could feel his strong arms encircling my waist tightly.
His intense gaze locked on mine, our faces close enough to feel each other's breath, and a smirk crossed his lips as he whispered deep and low, "You're trouble, aren't you?"
An electric thrill ran through me as I slowly nodded in agreement, and a fire ignited deep within me. Nothing could ever keep us from embarking on that enticing adventure because we were both looking for trouble.
I inched closer to him and felt his bold and attentive hands running up and down my back, eliciting shivers of pleasure as they moved. Our lips met in a passionate kiss and I could feel the desire building between us; it was overwhelming, almost too much to contain. My heart was racing as we were consumed by this passion that had been building for weeks, allowing it to overwhelm our senses, and the car had become our personal haven. The sound of passing cars and distant voices only added to the excitement of our stolen moments together.
Despite the cramped space and the possibility of being caught, we continued to explore each other's bodies with an intensity that left us gasping for air. My hips gyrated against David's rock-hard manhood, still trapped in his jeans, and a guttural moan escaped his lips as he roughly grabbed my hips and pulled me closer to him.
As we indulged in our desires, I found myself losing control of my inhibitions. I couldn't resist his lips' magnetic pull, and I'd never felt more alive and free than in his embrace. It was an alluring sensation like no other. Every moment fueled our desire for more, and there was no turning back from this undeniable attraction, and I couldn't resist any longer, so I got up from him.
My hands went straight to his belt, eager to release his throbbing member. He leaned back in his seat and let out a low moan as I gripped his shaft firmly. I welcomed the deep, guttural sound and tightened my grip, stroking him slowly as he swelled under my touch.
With a sly grin, I leaned in and whispered, "I want to taste you."
My tongue flicked over the tip of his hardness, sending shivers down his spine. He grabbed my hair and pushed my head down, urging me to take him deeper into my mouth. I gladly obliged, relishing the feeling of his thickness sliding past my lips.
I took him in as deeply as I could until I gagged, and then slowly pulled back, using my tongue to swirl around the head of his cock. My saliva glistened on his length, and I could taste his salty pre-cum on my tongue, which only made me want him more. As I leisurely stroked him with my hand and saw the longing in his gaze, I took him back into my mouth, his intoxicating moans telling me how good it felt. I wanted to bring him to the brink again and again until he couldn't take it anymore.
David let out a throaty moan and tugged on my hair harder, his hips bucking as I trailed my tongue around the sensitive area of his manhood, making swirling circles that drove him wild with pleasure. I loved the way he responded to my touch, the way his body trembled and his breaths grew ragged. I knew I could make him lose control, and the thought excited me beyond measure.
With every movement, I could feel his pleasure growing, and as I brought him closer to the edge, I looked up at him and saw his eyes were closed, and face contorted with pleasure. Feeling emboldened, I quickened my pace, taking him deeper with every thrust. I couldn't help but gag every time his massive size hit the back of my throat, but I wanted to please him, so I pushed through the discomfort as he thrust into my mouth.
"Stop," David said abruptly, and I looked up, startled by his sudden command.
His eyes were pools of burning desire as he slowly slid out of my mouth, his hard manhood dripping with my juicy saliva.
With a satisfied grin, he looked down at me and whispered, "You're so good at this, but I want to feel you around me."
I couldn't wait to have him inside of me and didn't think twice about it. After removing my black lace thongs, I straddled him again, positioning myself to receive him, but he gripped my hips, keeping me just inches above his bulging erection.
"Not so fast, babe," he said, pulling a condom from his pocket.
David was aware that I was on the pill, but he insisted on using a condom, most likely to avoid staining his expensive car seats. I sighed and nodded, but I couldn't help but be disappointed because I craved to feel him inside of me without any barriers. After he rolled the condom on, I slowly slid down onto him, relishing the feeling of fullness as his hardness and having my walls stretched to their absolute limit as I took him in to the hilt.
As I began to rock back and forth, he reached under my top, cupping my breasts, and brushed his thumb back and forth over their softness, his desire evident in his touch. I moaned louder and louder, pressing my body against his, digging my nails deep into his shoulders, overcome by primal need. We were conscious of the risks of having sex in public, but the adrenaline rush only added to the thrill I felt with every touch and kiss. The car shook, and we both groaned with pleasure as I moved against him, my body straining to satisfy the longing in both of us.
"I love how tight you are," he said, his hands gripping my hips firmly, the heat between us growing with each thrust.
I let out a moan in response, lost in the pleasure that rippled through my body. We both knew we had to be quick before someone caught us, but for now, we were living in the moment and enjoying the raw, spontaneous passion between us.
Every thrust became more powerful and faster, pushing me closer to the edge. The blissful moans of pleasure emanating from deep within me mixed with the sound of my wet arousal echoed in the air as his rock-hard member sank deeper into me.
My walls pulsed around his thick shaft as his hands gripped my hips firmly and we picked up the pace. His intoxicating presence filled every inch of me, and I couldn't get enough of him. The sensation of being completely consumed by him was both terrifying and exhilarating.
We twisted and writhed with intensity as our longing bodies collided, coaxed by a chorus of tantalizing moans and pleasure-filled sighs as we whispered each other's names in the darkness of the night. The windows fogged up around us, creating an intimate and hazy atmosphere as we were both gasping for air and completely lost in the moment.
My body began to tremble violently as my orgasm approached. I had the distinct impression that someone was watching me, so I peered up through the window to see a stranger's intense eyes fixed on me. As I met the stranger's gaze, my heart pounded in my chest, and I felt a rush of excitement at the danger and taboo of being watched.
The man lurked in the shadows beside our car, shrouded in darkness, his eyes glowing in the dim light of the street lamp. I longed for a good glimpse of his face, although I knew that this moment of intrigue only added to his allure. The only light around us came from a single street lamp ahead of us, which shone inside the car, casting an eerie glow on the seats and revealing our silhouettes. Despite the fact that I was dressed and my skirt concealed what was happening beneath, I was aware that the stranger was fully aware of what was going on, which only increased my arousal.
The stranger's piercing stare made me feel exposed and vulnerable, yet strangely exhilarated. The middle-aged man watched me ride my boyfriend's cock with his approving gaze, filled with an unspoken desire for me. As I moaned with pleasure, I couldn't help but wonder what else he would want to watch me do. I couldn't resist the temptation to give him a seductive smile, silently daring him to keep watching. It was a thrilling game of temptation and desire with the stranger as our willing audience, and I couldn't help but want more of his intense attention.
I lost control as I kept my gaze fixed on the stranger's dark, gleaming eyes and succumbed to the powerful waves of pleasure coursing through my body. My body convulsed with every wave of ecstasy that crashed over me as my walls clenched around my boyfriend's cock and my world exploded in a white-hot burst of pleasure with a final, earth-shattering thrust as I reached my peak, my hips bucking uncontrollably and my groans echoing through the car. I clung to my boyfriend, gasping for air as he thrust rhythmically while I rode out my orgasm. It was a pure, unadulterated moment of passion that I knew I would never forget.
"Fuck," my boyfriend yelled angrily, jolting me back to reality.
With a single savage motion, David tore me away from him, cinched his pants over his still-stiff member, and strode out of the car. I sat there, dazed from my blissful satisfaction, as my boyfriend raced off towards a mysterious stranger who had been observing us having sex. David's face grew red and his fists clenched tightly as he bellowed at the intruder with a mix of ferocity and rage.
"Get out of here! Now!"
The stranger stumbled backward, clearly intimidated by my boyfriend's display of aggression, and quickly fled the scene. My boyfriend 's anger dissipated as he took a deep breath and turned to me, his eyes softening.
"Are you okay?" he inquired as he slid into the front seat, his tone gentle and concerned.
I nodded slowly and hesitantly, my brain unable to fully comprehend the intensity of what had just transpired. Sitting with these feelings, there was a weird amalgamation of pleasure and guilt that lingered in the air as I thought about my actions. Despite this confusion, I couldn't deny the excitement that coursed through me like waves on an ocean beach--and it felt amazing. I knew I had taken a risk, but the adrenaline rush was worth it. As I reflected on my decision, I couldn't help but wonder if I would do it again.
I put on my thongs before climbing into the passenger seat. My boyfriend unzipped his pants, removed the condom from his still-half-erect cock, and placed it in a trash bag that he had previously prepared. My orgasm had been cut off earlier, and seeing his cock made me salivate. His cock twitched, almost as if it sensed how badly I wanted it back inside me.
"I could help you with that," I said, licking my lips and staring at David's erection, eager to pick up where we left off.
He looked at me as if I were insane, and his voice was serious. "No way," he said firmly. "I'm not risking that creep coming back. We'll have to wait until we have some privacy."
I nodded in agreement, but inside I was frustrated and disappointed as I watched him zip up his pants.
"On the bright side," David said, "at least you didn't notice he was there, and you got to finish."
I couldn't even look my boyfriend in the eyes as I sank into the cool leather seat, blushing, because I was enjoying the adrenaline rush of being caught in the act by a stranger, and David's remark made me feel embarrassed. I knew I should stop looking for thrills, but a small part of me wished for another exhilarating experience like that. A wave of unease washed over me as I wondered if David could feel my guilt and shame emanating from every fiber of my being.
As David turned the key in the ignition, a powerful roar echoed throughout the car, and every single vibration traveled through my body. With each engine rev, my heart rate increased, and each passing second felt more electric than the last as the adrenaline rush from tonight's events still lingered in my veins. I felt incredibly alive, but also a little ashamed--I shouldn't have been so aroused by it all.
The silence was palpable as we drove through the empty streets, and I couldn't help but feel dampened by the weight of what had just happened, and I shivered.
"You must be cold," David said, activating the heated massage seat.
As the massage seat's vibrations hummed through me, I sank deeper into its embrace. My eyes closed as I indulged in the pleasurable sensation of warm, tingling relaxation that coursed throughout my body. With each passing second, my pussy throbbed with increasing intensity, and a low moan escaped me involuntarily, drawing David's curious gaze.
Trying to avoid any further awkwardness, I forced a laugh and said dismissively, "Umm, this seat is so comfortable!"
David smirked, but thankfully did not press the issue any further. I adjusted my position and tried to concentrate on the road ahead to distract myself from the pulsing sensation between my legs. As he drove through unfamiliar areas of the city, I became perplexed.
"Where are we going?" I asked, my voice trembling.
He looked at me with a knowing smile and said, "We're finishing what we started, so I'm taking you to my place."
I knew that David lived with his father and that his mother had left them when David was a child. His father raised him single-handedly, and the two were close; David often spoke highly of him. Since he was taking me home to meet his father, I reasoned that this relationship between us must mean something to him.
"Shouldn't you check with your dad to see if he's okay with me coming over?" I proposed.
David shook his head and replied, "Nah, he is still at work and won't even know you're there, because I'll sneak you out before the morning."
His response made me uneasy, as if he were trying to hide our relationship, but I didn't want to press the issue, so I just nodded and enjoyed the rest of the ride, allowing the car's massage seat's tantalizing vibration to drive pleasure through my body.
